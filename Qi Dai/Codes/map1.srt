ENGINEERING AND THE ENGINEER

00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:44,360


131
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:44,360


132
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,120
Several years ago, at the regular annual meeting of one of the major

133
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,440
engineering societies, the president of the society, in the formal

134
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,800
address with which he opened the meeting, gave expression to a thought

135
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,280
so startling that the few laymen who were seated in the auditorium

136
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,960
fairly gasped. What the president said in effect was that, since

137
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:13,920
engineers had got the world into war, it was the duty of engineers to

138
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,040
get the world out of war. As a thought, it probably reflected the secret

139
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:24,720
opinion of every engineer present, for, however innocent of intended

140
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,640
wrong-doing engineers assuredly are as a group in their work of

141
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,000
scientific investigation and development, the statement that engineers

142
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,440
were responsible for the conflict then raging in Europe was absolute

143
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,400
truth.

144
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:39,400


145
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,840
I mention this merely to bring to the reader's attention the tremendous

146
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,760
power which engineers wield in world affairs.

147
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:47,760


148
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,200
The profession of engineering--which, by the way, is merely the adapting

149
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,160
of discoveries in science and art to the uses of mankind--is a

150
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:03,040
peculiarly isolated one. But very little is known about it among those

151
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,080
outside of the profession. Laymen know something about law, a little

152
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,640
about medicine, quite a lot--nowadays--about metaphysics. But laymen

153
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:18,680
know nothing about engineering. Indeed, a source of common amusement

154
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:23,680
among engineers is the peculiar fact that the average layman cannot

155
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,320
differentiate between the man who runs a locomotive and the man who

156
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,720
designs a locomotive. In ordinary parlance both are called engineers.

157
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,640
Yet there is a difference between them--a difference as between day and

158
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:42,880
night. For one merely operates the results of the creative genius of the

159
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,880
other. This almost universal ignorance as to what constitutes an

160
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,520
engineer serves to show to what broad extent the profession of

161
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,800
engineering is isolated.

162
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:53,800


163
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,600
Yet it is a wonderful profession. I say this with due regard for all

164
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:03,680
other professions. For one cannot but ponder the fact that, if

165
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,560
engineers started the greatest war the world has ever known--and

166
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,920
engineers as a body freely admit that if they did not start it they at

167
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:17,680
least made it possible--they also stopped it, thereby proving themselves

168
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,120
possessed of a power greater than that of any other class of

169
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,040
professional men--diplomats and lawyers and divinities not excepted.

170
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,040


171
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,440
That engineering is a force fraught with stupendous possibilities,

172
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:35,720
therefore, nobody can very well deny. That it is a force generally

173
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:41,480
exercised for good--despite the World War--I myself, as an engineer, can

174
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:46,040
truly testify. With some fifteen years spent on the creative end of the

175
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:50,840
work--the drafting and designing end--I have yet to see, with but two or

176
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,840
three rare exceptions, the genius of engineers turned into any but noble

177
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,960
channels.

178
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:56,960


179
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,760
Thus, engineering is not only a wonderful profession, with the

180
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,720
activities of its followers of utmost importance, but also it is a

181
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,600
profession the individual work of whose pioneers, from Watt to

182
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,080
Westinghouse and from Eiffel to Edison, has been epoch-making.

183
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,080


184
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,600
For when James Watt, clock-repairer, tinker, being called into a certain

185
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,200
small laboratory in England more than a century ago to make a few minor

186
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:32,080
repairs on a new design of steam-engine, discovered, while at work on

187
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,120
this crude unit deriving its motion from expanded steam and the

188
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,760
alternate workings of a lever actuated by a weight, the value of

189
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:46,120
superheated steam for power purposes, and later embodied the idea in a

190
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:51,480
steam-engine of his own, Watt set the civilized world forward into an

191
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:55,840
era so full of promise and discovery that even we who are living to-day,

192
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,880
despite the wonderful progress already made in mechanics as represented

193
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:06,120
among other things in the high-speed engine, the dynamo, the airplane,

194
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,960
are witnessing but the barest of beginnings.

195
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:08,960


196
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:14,760
Likewise, when George Westinghouse, inventor of the airbrake, having

197
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:19,680
finally persuaded the directors of the Pennsylvania Railroad, after many

198
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,880
futile attempts in other directions, to grant him an opportunity to try

199
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,640
out his invention, and, trying it out--on a string of cars near

200
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:34,200
Harrisburg--ably demonstrated its practicability as a device for

201
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:39,520
stopping trains and preventing accidents, he also--as had Watt before

202
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,920
him--set the civilized world forward into an era full of promise and

203
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:49,000
discovery as yet but barely entered upon, even with the remarkable

204
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,080
progress already made in industry alone in the matter of regard for the

205
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:58,240
safety of human life--Westinghouse's own particular blazed trail through

206
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,440
the forest of human ignorance this same airbrake.

207
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:01,440


208
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,520
So with other pioneers--with Eiffel, in the field of tower construction;

209
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:11,720
with Edison, in the field of electricity; with the Wright brothers, in

210
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,680
the field of aerial navigation; With Simon Lake, inventor of the

211
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:22,280
submarine boat. All were pioneers; all set the civilized world forward;

212
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:27,040
all--though this perhaps is irrelevant, yet it will serve to reveal the

213
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,920
type of men these pioneers were and are--all overcame great

214
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,760
obstacles--Lake not the least among them.

215
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:33,760


216
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:39,040
Told that he was visionary, when Lake explained, as he did in his effort

217
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:44,000
to enlist capital with which to build his first submarine boat, that he

218
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,080
could safely submerge his invention and steer it about on the bed of the

219
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,040
ocean as readily as a man can steer an automobile about the streets of a

220
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,400
city, that while submerged he could step out of the boat through a

221
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:02,080
trap-door without flooding the boat, by the simple process of

222
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,280
maintaining a greater air pressure inside than the pressure of the water

223
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:12,560
outside--Simon Lake, discouraged on every hand, finally decided to build

224
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,440
a boat himself, and did build one, with his own hands--a boat fourteen

225
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,360
feet long and constructed of rough pine timbers painted with

226
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,560
coal-tar--in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey. With this boat Lake

227
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,480
demonstrated to a skeptical world for all time that he was neither a

228
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,880
visionary nor a dreamer, but a practical doer among men--an engineer.

229
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:35,880


230
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:41,600
Of such stuff, then, were, and are, engineers made. Whether they

231
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,040
realized it or not, whether the world at large realized it or not, each

232
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,200
represented a noble calling, each was a professional man, each was

233
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,920
chiseling his name for all time into the granite foundations of a

234
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:01,360
wonderful profession even yet only in the building--engineering. Their

235
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,080
name is legion, too, and their names will last because of the fact that

236
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,400
their work, remaining as it does after them equally with the work of

237
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:15,480
followers of the finest of the fine arts, is known to mankind as a

238
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:21,040
benefit to mankind. Known by their works, the list extends back to the

239
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,880
very dawn of history.

240
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:22,880


241
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,760
For it was men of this calling, the calling of engineers, who in the

242
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,600
early days wrought for purposes of warfare--warfare then being the major

243
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:38,280
industry--the javelin, the spear, the helmet, the coat of mail, the

244
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:44,120
plate of armor, the slingshot; just as their later brothers, for a like

245
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:49,560
purpose, conceived and devised the throwing of mustard gas, the two-ton

246
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:54,880
explosive, the aerial bomb, the mortar shell, the hand-grenade--for the

247
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:00,360
protection, false and true, of the home. For the upbuilding of the home,

248
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,120
for the continuance of the home, men of this calling also it was who

249
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,360
conceived and shaped, among other things, the cook-stove, the chimney,

250
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:15,400
the wheel, the steam-engine, the spinning-jenny, the suspension-bridge,

251
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:21,320
the bedspring-oh, boy!--the bicycle, the sandblast, the automobile, the

252
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,560
airplane, the wireless.

253
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:23,560


254
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:27,520
Thus it will be seen that engineering is a distinctive and important

255
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:33,400
profession. To some even it is the topmost of all professions. However

256
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:38,160
true that may or may not be to-day, certain it is that some day it will

257
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,360
be true, for the reason that engineers serve humanity at every practical

258
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,520
turn. Engineers make life easier to live--easier in the living; their

259
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:54,040
work is strictly constructive, sharply exact; the results positive. Not

260
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,280
a profession outside of the engineering profession but that has its

261
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:02,240
moments of wabbling and indecision--of faltering on the part of

262
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,720
practitioners between the true and the untrue. Engineering knows no such

263
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:13,480
weakness. Two and two make four. Engineers know that. Knowing it, and

264
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:18,200
knowing also the unnumbered possible manifoldings of this fundamental

265
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:23,880
truism, engineers can, and do, approach a problem with a certainty of

266
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:28,520
conviction and a confidence in the powers of their working-tools nowhere

267
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,400
permitted men outside the profession.

268
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:31,400


269
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:31,400


270
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:31,400


271
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:31,400


272
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,240
II

273
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:32,240


274
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,240
ENGINEERING OPPORTUNITIES

275
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:34,240


276
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:34,240


277
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,720
The writer can best illustrate the opportunities for young men which

278
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,880
exist in engineering by a little story. The story is true in every

279
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:49,400
particular. Nor is the case itself exceptional. Men occupying high

280
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:54,280
places everywhere in engineering, did they but tell their story, would

281
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:58,800
repeat in substance what is set forth below. More than any other

282
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,440
profession to-day, engineering holds out opportunities for young men

283
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,760
possessing the requisite "will to success" and the physical stamina

284
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:13,320
necessary to carry them forward to the goal. Opportunities in any walk

285
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,840
of life are not all dead--not all in the past. A young man to-day can go

286
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:23,160
as far as he wills. He can go farther on less capital invested in

287
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,560
engineering than in any other profession--that's all.

288
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:26,560


289
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,280
The young man's name was Smith. He was one of seven children--not the

290
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:36,960
seventh son, either--in a poor family. At the age of sixteen he went to

291
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:42,520
work in overalls on a section of railroad as a helper--outdoor, rough

292
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:47,960
work. At seventeen he was transferred to the roundhouse; at nineteen he

293
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:53,160
apprenticed himself to the machinist trade. Engineering? He did not know

294
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:58,520
what it was, really. Merely he saw his way clear to earning a livelihood

295
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,760
and went after it. He was miserably educated. His knowledge of

296
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:08,360
mathematics embraced arithmetic up to fractions, at which point it faded

297
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:13,400
off into blissful "nothingness"--as our New-Thoughtists say. But he had

298
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:18,600
an inquiring mind and a proper will to succeed. While serving his three

299
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,560
years in the shop he bought a course in a correspondence school and

300
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:29,040
studied nights, taking up, among other things, the subject of mechanical

301
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:34,480
drafting. When twenty-two years of age he applied for, and got, a

302
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,880
position as draftsman in a small company developing a motorcycle. He was

303
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,600
well on his way upward.

304
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:41,600


305
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,160
He spent a year with this company. He learned much of value to him not

306
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:51,720
only about mathematics, but about engineering as a whole as well. One

307
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:56,800
day he decided that the field was restricted--at least, too much so for

308
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,400
him--and he left and went with a Westinghouse organization in

309
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,840
Pittsburgh. His salary was in the neighborhood of a hundred and ten

310
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:09,400
dollars a month. He remained with the company two years as a designer,

311
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:14,840
and then, having saved up sufficient funds to meet his needs, went to

312
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:20,240
college, taking special work--physics and chemistry and mathematics. He

313
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,360
remained in school two years. When he came out, instead of returning to

314
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,760
the drafting-room and the theoretical end of the work, he donned

315
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:35,200
overalls once more and went to work in the shop as an erecting man. Two

316
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:40,080
years afterward he was chief operating engineer in a small cement-plant

317
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:45,840
in the Southwest, his salary being three thousand dollars a year. A year

318
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:50,760
of this and he returned East, at a salary of four thousand dollars a

319
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:56,280
year, as operating engineer of a larger plant. Then came a better offer,

320
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:02,080
with one of the largest, if not the very largest, steel-plants in the

321
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:07,000
country, as superintendent of power, at a salary of five thousand

322
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,160
dollars a year. When the war broke out, or rather when this country

323
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:17,680
became involved in the war, my friend Smith, at a salary of ten thousand

324
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,600
dollars a year, became associated with a staff of engineers brought

325
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:28,120
together into a corporation manufacturing shells. And all before he was

326
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,040
barely in his thirties!

327
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:30,040


328
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:35,800
A young man still, what lies ahead of him can readily be surmised. Smith

329
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,920
will follow engineering on salary until he is probably forty, when he

330
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:45,680
will enter upon a consulting practice, and at fifty retire with

331
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:51,160
sufficient money to keep him in comfort the remainder of his days. Nor

332
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:56,280
will he be an exception, as I have stated in the opening paragraph. The

333
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:00,600
profession is crowded with men who have worked up from equally humble

334
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:06,040
beginnings. Indeed, one of the foremost efficiency engineers in the

335
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:11,320
country to-day began as an apprentice in a foundry, while another, fully

336
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:16,440
as well known in efficiency work, began life in the United States navy

337
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:22,440
as a machinist's mate. Automobile engineers, whose names, many of them,

338
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:27,280
are household words, in particular have gone big in the profession and

339
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:32,080
from very obscure beginnings. It is not stretching the obvious to say

340
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,720
that the majority of these men, had they entered upon any other work,

341
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,320
would never have been heard from nor have attained to their present

342
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:45,560
wealth and affluence. Smith was just one of many in a profession

343
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:50,640
offering liberal opportunities. The opportunities still exist and in

344
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,640
just as large a proportion as they ever existed. It remains but for the

345
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:01,320
young man to decide. The profession itself, almost, will take care of

346
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,480
him afterward.

347
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:02,480


348
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,240
However, not all of our engineers have gone upward by the overalls

349
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:12,240
route. Nor is it at all necessary to do this in order to attain to

350
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,480
success. The high-school graduate, entering a college of engineering,

351
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:23,240
has an equal chance. Some maintain that he has a better chance. Certain

352
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,240
it is that he is better qualified to cope with the heavier theoretical

353
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:32,520
problems which come up every day in the average engineer's work. There

354
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:37,880
is a place for him, side by side with the practical man, and his

355
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:42,200
knowledge will be everywhere respected and sought. But a combination of

356
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:46,680
the theoretical and the practical, as has frequently been declared,

357
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:51,760
makes for the complete engineer. Some get the practical side first and

358
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,920
the theoretical side later; some get the theoretical side first and the

359
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:01,800
practical side later. It matters little--save only that he who gets the

360
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:06,560
practical side first is earning his way while getting it, while the man

361
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:10,960
who goes to college is in the majority of cases being supported from

362
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,680
outside sources while getting what he wants. But in the end it balances.

363
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:22,560
Merely, the "full" engineer must have both. Having both, he has,

364
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:27,760
literally, the world within his grasp. For engineering is--to

365
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,000
repeat--the adapting of discoveries in science and art to the uses of

366
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,960
mankind. And both art and science reflect and are drawn from Mother

367
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,080
Nature.

368
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:38,080


369
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,800
There is still a great scarcity of engineers. All branches feel the

370
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:48,600
need--civil, mechanical, mining, chemical, automotive, electrical--the

371
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:53,880
call goes out. It is a call just now, owing to the vast reconstruction

372
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:59,200
period confronting the world, lifted in strident voice. Engineers

373
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,560
everywhere are needed, which in part accounts for the liberal salaries

374
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:09,280
offered for experienced men. The demand greatly exceeds the supply, and

375
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,880
gives promise of exceeding it for a number of years to come. All

376
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:19,360
manufacturing-plants, all mining enterprises, of which of both there are

377
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:24,480
thousands upon thousands, utilize each from one to many hundreds of

378
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,520
engineers. Some plants make use of three or four different

379
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:34,800
kinds--mechanical, civil, electrical, industrial--some only one. But not

380
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:40,480
a plant of any size but that has need for at least one engineer, and

381
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,600
engineers are scarce. Therefore opportunities are ample.

382
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:44,600


383
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:49,160
To the young man seeking a profession, provided he be of a certain

384
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:53,960
type--possessed of certain inherent qualities, the nature of which I

385
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:58,040
shall set forth in the following chapter--engineering offers

386
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:03,160
satisfactory money returns and--more satisfactory still--a satisfactory

387
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:08,000
life. The work is creative from beginning to end; it has to do

388
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,080
frequently with movement--always a source of delight to mankind; a

389
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:17,960
source having its beginnings in earliest infancy, and it is essentially

390
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:24,200
a work of service. To build a bridge, to design an automatic machine, to

391
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,560
locate and bring to the surface earth's wealth in minerals--surely this

392
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:32,000
is service of a most gratifying kind.

393
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,000


394
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,120
And it pays. The arts rarely pay; science always pays. And engineering

395
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:42,680
being a science, a science in the pursuit of which also man is offered

396
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:48,320
opportunities for the exercise of his creative instincts, like art, is

397
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:53,120
therefore doubly gratifying as a life's work. I know--and it will bear

398
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,120
repeating--no other profession that holds so much of bigness and of

399
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:03,120
fullness of life generally. Engineers themselves reflect it. Usually

400
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:09,200
robust, always active, generally optimistic, engineers as a group swing

401
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,880
through life--and have swung through life from the beginnings of the

402
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:18,080
profession--without thought of publicity, for instance, or need or

403
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:23,400
desire for it. Their work alone engrossed their minds. It was enough--it

404
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,840
is enough--and more. And that which is sufficient unto a man is Nirvana

405
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,520
unto him--if he but knew it. Engineers seem to know it.

406
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:31,520


407
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:31,520


408
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:31,520


409
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:31,520


410
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,480
III

411
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:32,480


412
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,960
THE ENGINEERING TYPE

413
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:33,960


414
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:33,960


415
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:38,520
It is becoming more and more an accepted fact that engineers, or

416
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:43,920
physicians, or lawyers--like our poets--are born and not made. I believe

417
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:48,920
this to be true. Educators generally are thinking seriously along these

418
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:53,600
lines, with the result that vocational advisers are springing up,

419
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,920
especially in industrial circles, to establish eventually yet another

420
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:03,880
profession. Instinct leads young men to enter upon certain callings,

421
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:09,040
unless turned off by misguided parents or guardians, and as a general

422
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:13,520
thing the hunch works out successfully. Philosophers from time

423
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:18,360
immemorial, including Plato and Emerson, have written of this still,

424
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:23,360
small voice within, and have urged that it be heeded. The thing is

425
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,320
instinct--cumulative yearnings within man of thousands of his

426
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:31,720
ancestors--and to disobey it is to fling defiance at Nature herself.

427
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:36,440
Personally, I believe that when this law becomes more generally

428
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:40,960
understood there will be fewer failures decorating park benches in our

429
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,480
cities and cracker-boxes in our country stores.

430
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:44,480


431
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:49,600
The profession of engineering, therefore, has its type. You may be of

432
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:55,360
this type or you may not. The type is quite pronounced, however, and you

433
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:00,200
need not go wrong in your decision. All professions and all trades have

434
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,960
their types. Steel-workers--those fearless young men who balance

435
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:10,000
skilfully on a girder, frequently hundreds of feet in the air--are not

436
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,680
to be mistaken. Rough, rugged, gray-eyed; with frames close-knit and

437
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:20,840
usually squat; generous with money, and unconcerned as to the future;

438
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:27,240
living each day regardless of the next, and _living_ it--steel-workers

439
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:31,800
are as distinct from the clerical type--slender, tall, a bit

440
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:36,720
self-conscious, fearful of themselves and of the future--I say, the

441
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,240
steel-worker is as different from the clerical worker as the

442
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:45,360
circus-driver is from the cleric. Their work marks them for its own, if

443
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:50,200
a man lack it upon entering the work, just as the school-room marks the

444
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,400
teacher in time for its own. The thing is not to be mistaken.

445
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:54,400


446
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,760
The successful engineer must be possessed of a certain fondness for

447
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:04,120
figures. The subject of mathematics must interest him. He must like to

448
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:09,000
figure, to use a colloquialism, and his fondness for it must be

449
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,560
genuine, almost an absorption. It must reveal itself to him at an early

450
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:20,800
age, too, as early as his grammar-school days, for then it will be known

451
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:26,280
as genuinely a part of him, and the outcropping of seeds correctly sown

452
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:31,960
by his ancestors. Having this fondness for mathematics, which may be

453
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:36,440
termed otherwise as a curiosity to make concrete ends meet--the working

454
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:41,280
out of puzzles is one evidence of the gift--the young man is well armed

455
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:46,400
for a successful career in the profession. He will like mathematics for

456
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:52,240
its own sake, and when, later, in college, and later still, in the

457
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,880
active pursuit of his chosen work, he is confronted with a difficult

458
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,840
problem covering strains or stress in a beam or lever or connecting-rod,

459
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:07,240
he will attack it eagerly, instead of--as I have seen such problems

460
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:11,160
attacked more than once--irritably and with marked mental effort.

461
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:11,160


462
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:15,880
The successful engineer must be a man who likes to shape things with his

463
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:22,080
hands. He need not always do it, and probably will not after he has

464
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,960
attained to recognition, save only as he supervises or makes the

465
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,240
mechanical drawings--the picture--of the thing. But the itch must be

466
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:36,880
present in the man. And, like the desire within him to figure, it must

467
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:42,000
make itself manifest within him early in life. If a young man be of

468
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,200
those who early like to crawl in under the family buzz-wagon; tinker

469
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,200
there for half a day at a time; emerge in a thick coating of grease and

470
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:56,360
dust and with joy in his eye--such a young man has the necessary

471
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:02,240
qualifications for a successful engineer. He may never do this--as I

472
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,720
say--in all his engineering career. But the yearning must be as much a

473
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,160
part of him as his love for mathematics--so much so that all his

474
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:15,840
engineering days he will feel something akin to envy for the machinist

475
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,880
who works over a machine of the engineer's own devising--and it must be

476
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,320
vitally a part of him. To illustrate:

477
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:24,320


478
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,720
When only twelve years old the author, in company with several

479
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:33,840
playmates, decided one November day to build an ice-boat. From the

480
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,400
numerous building operations going on in the neighborhood, in the light

481
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:43,440
of the moon, he secured the necessary timbers, and from a neighbor's

482
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,000
back yard--also in the light of the moon--he got a young sapling which

483
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,560
served delightfully as a mainmast. With the needed materials all

484
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:57,120
gathered, it suddenly struck him that a plan of some kind ought to be

485
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:02,440
made of the proposed ice-boat, in order to guard against grave errors

486
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:07,600
in construction. To think was to act with this bright youngster. He got

487
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,640
him his mother's bread-board and a pencil and an ordinary school ruler,

488
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:15,880
and with these made a drawing of the ice-boat as he thought the boat

489
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:21,480
should be. Knowing nothing of mechanical drawing, and but very little of

490
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:26,440
construction of any kind, he nevertheless devised a pretty fair-looking

491
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:32,080
boat and not a bad working drawing. One of his playmates, whose father

492
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,960
was something or other in a manufacturing-plant, showed the drawing to

493
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,880
the family circle; with the result that the kid's father, laying a rule

494
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:47,440
upon the drawing, pronounced it an accurate mechanical drawing, drawn to

495
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,040
scale--which was one inch to the foot--and sent for the youthful

496
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,480
designer, meaning me.

497
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:53,480


498
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:57,840
"What do you know about mechanical drawings?" he asked the bashful

499
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,240
youngster, pointing to the drawing under discussion.

500
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:01,240


501
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:06,200
"I don't know nothing about it," replied the kid--meaning me again. "I

502
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,800
just made it with a ruler."

503
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:07,800


504
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:12,440
"But how come you made it to scale? That drawing is a complete plan and

505
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:17,520
elevation of an ice-boat, drawn accurately to scale." He looked

506
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,640
thoughtful. "I don't understand it. You ought to take up with drafting,

507
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:26,920
my boy, when you get a little older. I never knew of a case like it.

508
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,320
What does your father do?" he suddenly asked.

509
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:30,320


510
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:36,360
"He's an ice-dealer,"[1] replied the discomfited boy. "I just made

511
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:41,480
it--that's all. We need it, too, to go ahead." Turning to his playmate,

512
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:45,000
"Come on out, Jack; the gang is waiting."

513
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:45,000


514
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,280
Which terminated the interview.

515
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:47,280


516
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:51,800
Yet the thing was the beginning of a career for the boy. The boat in

517
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:56,560
time somehow got itself built and out upon the little river; but owing

518
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:01,520
to the fact that its materials were stolen, the river failed to freeze

519
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,760
over that winter, and for three winters following--not till the boat

520
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:10,720
itself had fallen apart from disuse and lack of care--which points its

521
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:16,600
own moral, as hinted at above. If you must build ice-boats, and you are

522
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:21,440
a kid with mechanical yearnings, pay for the material that goes into the

523
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,640
making of your product. But the thing--as I say--was the beginning of a

524
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:31,240
career for the lad. In time, through the kindly office of his playmate's

525
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:35,600
father, he became apprenticed in a drafting-room of a large

526
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:40,920
manufacturing-plant--and the rest was easy. In his first year, on paper,

527
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:46,560
he devised a steam-engine with novel arrangement of slide-valves, and

528
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:50,600
thereafter for years designed engines and machinery about the country,

529
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,840
always quite successfully.

530
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:52,880


531
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:57,080
The successful engineer, while possessed of certain spiritual

532
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:02,360
characteristics, must also--if I may be so bold as to say so--be

533
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:07,440
possessed of certain physical characteristics. One of these is large,

534
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:13,760
and what is known as capable, hands. Short, spatulate fingers, with a

535
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:18,640
broad palm, appear to be a feature of the successful engineer. Of

536
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:24,040
course, there are exceptions, as there are exceptions to every rule, but

537
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:28,400
in the majority of cases which have come under the writer's observation

538
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:34,080
the successful engineer has had hands of this shaping. He likewise has

539
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,440
had wrists and arms to match with such hands, and--in the practical

540
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:43,000
engineer--that is, the engineer whose particular gift is coping with

541
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,280
ordinary problems of construction, as against the genius who blazes new

542
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:53,440
trails, like Watt and Westinghouse and Edison and Marconi and the Wright

543
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:58,600
brothers--a head whose contour was along the "well-shaped" lines. The

544
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:04,080
so-called genius usually has an odd-shaped head, I've noticed, but for

545
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:08,360
purposes of this book we shall confine ourselves to the average

546
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,920
successful man in engineering.

547
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:10,960


548
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:16,000
Thus you have, roughly, the engineering type. I have sketched only the

549
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,400
major characteristics. The minor characteristics embrace many features.

550
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:26,200
There is patience, for one--patience to labor long with difficulties;

551
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:32,080
concentration, for another; application, for a third; certain student

552
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:37,480
qualities, for yet a fourth. Many graduate engineers have gone off into

553
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:41,600
other work immediately after leaving college because of a clearly

554
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:46,680
defined dislike for detail in construction. The average successful

555
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:51,080
engineer will be a man interested in the shaping of the details of his

556
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:57,240
machine or bridge or plant. To many, details are irksome. If the young

557
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:01,240
man who is reading this book knows that he dislikes a detail of any

558
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:06,520
character whatsoever, unless he be possessed of the creative genius of a

559
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:10,760
Westinghouse or an Edison, he would better take up with some other

560
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:16,600
profession. For engineering, in the last analysis, is the manipulating

561
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:20,680
of detailed parts into a perfect whole--whether it be a bridge or a

562
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,680
machine or a plant.

563
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:22,680


564
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:22,680

574
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,440
THE FOUR MAJOR BRANCHES

575
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:30,440


576
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:30,440


577
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:34,680
The four major branches of engineering are civil, mechanical,

578
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:39,520
electrical, and mining. I give them in the order of their acceptance

579
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:45,040
among engineers. Each is separate from each of the others, and each is a

580
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:49,600
profession in itself, and as distinctive from each of the others as is

581
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:54,680
the allopathic from the homeopathic among men of medicine, though not

582
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:58,840
with quite the same distinction. Whereas the several groups of

583
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:03,040
physicians seek to relieve pain and correct disorder by way of

584
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:08,120
diversified channels, the several groups of engineers each work in a

585
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:12,240
field of endeavor actively apart from each of the other groups.

586
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:17,800
Sometimes one group will lap over upon another group, in certain kinds

587
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:22,240
of construction work, but even then the branches will hold sharply each

588
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,440
to its own.

589
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:23,440


590
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:29,080
Civil engineering embraces, roughly, all work in the soil. The surveyor

591
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:35,120
is a civil engineer. He constructs dams, builds viaducts, lays out

592
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:40,480
railroads, and in the war, where he was known as a pioneer, he was

593
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:45,400
responsible for all tunneling and trench projects, besides keeping the

594
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:50,560
highways clear and the wire entanglements intact. Civil engineering is a

595
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:55,360
profession which keeps its followers pretty well out in the open. A

596
00:34:55,360 --> 00:35:00,920
civil engineer will go long distances, and frequently must, in order to

597
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:06,400
get to his work, and, having reached the scene of his labors, enters

598
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,760
upon a rugged outdoor life in camp where he remains until the job is

599
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:16,360
completed. The Panama Canal was a civil-engineering job--probably the

600
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:21,720
largest of its kind ever undertaken--and its success, after failure on

601
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:26,280
the part of another government, is a high tribute to the genius of our

602
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,200
own civil engineers.

603
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:28,200


604
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:32,800
Mechanical engineering is a profession whose medium of endeavor lies in

605
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:37,920
the metals. Mechanical engineers shape things out of iron or steel or

606
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,880
brass or other metal compositions, and put these things into engines or

607
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:48,240
machines for service. All machinery, whether it be printing-presses or

608
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:53,000
automobiles or steam-engines, is the work of mechanical engineers,

609
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,160
though in the matter of automobiles this has become a profession by

610
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:02,720
itself, one of the minor branches known as automotive engineering. The

611
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:07,560
mechanical engineer as a rule works within doors, just as the civil

612
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:13,120
engineer works out of doors, and his work, consequently, is more

613
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:17,800
confining. In the pursuit of his profession he spends much of his time

614
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:23,000
supervising the design of mechanical units, and is the one man

615
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,640
responsible for correct construction and security against fracture of

616
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:32,800
the machine itself when in operation. Actually the mechanical engineer

617
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:37,600
has more opportunities in his daily routine for the exercise of his

618
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:43,520
creative faculties than has any one of the other kinds of engineers, for

619
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,240
the simple reason that no two machines even for the same

620
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:52,400
purpose--speaking of types, always--are exactly similar in construction.

621
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:57,960
Two lathes of like size and scope, if manufactured by two separate

622
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:03,120
organizations, will be different in their minor features, and each in

623
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:07,680
some particular will be the work of a mechanical engineer whose ideas

624
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:11,880
are at variance with those of the mechanical engineer who designed the

625
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:18,520
other type. Engineers, like doctors, often disagree, which accounts for

626
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:22,720
the many different types of machinery serving the same purpose which are

627
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,720
found on the market.

628
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:24,720


629
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:30,160
Electrical engineering is, as its name implies, a profession embracing

630
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:34,840
all construction whose basis is the electrical current. Any unit

631
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:39,680
whatsoever, so long as it utilizes or eats up or carries forward a

632
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:45,080
current of electricity, is the work of electrical engineers. The

633
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:50,080
profession is a comparatively recent one perforce, owing to the fact

634
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:53,960
that but very little of a practical nature was known about electricity

635
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:59,720
until a very few years ago. The wonderful progress in this field made

636
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:03,840
within the past twenty years is one of the marvels of the engineering

637
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:10,480
profession. Dynamos, motors, arc-lights, alternating current, the

638
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,520
X-ray--these are a few of the things which followers of the profession

639
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:19,760
have created for the uses of mankind. The field is yet practically

640
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,520
unexplored, and offers to engineering students an outlet for their

641
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:28,960
energies--provided they enter this branch of engineering--second to none

642
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:34,120
of the other branches. A fascinating study, doubly so because of the

643
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:38,680
fact that nothing is known about electricity itself--its effects only

644
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:42,280
being understood--electrical engineering should appeal to the

645
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:47,840
curious-minded as no other vocation can. It is a profession shrouded in

646
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:52,600
mystery, and not the least mysterious of its recent developments is the

647
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:57,640
wireless telegraph. What this one development alone holds for the future

648
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:03,520
nobody can say. All sorts of inventions can be imagined, however, and

649
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:08,040
among them I myself seem to see automobiles operated from central

650
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:13,200
stations--indeed, all mechanical movements so operated--to the end that

651
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,520
individual engines in time will cease to be.

652
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:16,520


653
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:20,840
The profession of mining engineering, last of the major branches,

654
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:25,400
embraces all work having to do with the locating and construction of

655
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:32,360
mines--coal-mines, iron-mines, copper-mines, diamond-mines, gold-mines,

656
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:37,160
and the like. Also it establishes the nature of the apparatus used,

657
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:41,960
though more often than otherwise the mechanical engineer in this regard

658
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:47,360
is consulted, since much of the machinery utilized in mining operations

659
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:52,400
is the direct work of mechanical engineers. Screens and hoppers are

660
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:57,760
mechanical devices the result of mechanical engineering genius; but the

661
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:02,240
work of shoring up, done with timbers, and the work generally of

662
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:07,840
supervision of all mine operations, rests solely with the mining man.

663
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:12,760
The shaping of these timbers, though--the cutting of tenons, for

664
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:17,560
instance--is the work, again, of the mechanical engineer; though the

665
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:22,560
placing of these timbers, to revert back once more, is the work of the

666
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,160
mining engineer.

667
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:24,160


668
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:28,800
There are many minor branches, and more are rapidly coming into

669
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:33,800
prominence. Chemical engineering is one of the older minor branches;

670
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:38,120
while industrial engineering--following closely upon automotive

671
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:42,240
engineering--belongs properly with the more recent of the newcomers.

672
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:47,000
Efficiency engineering is a branch which to-day is making a strong bid

673
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:53,280
for recognition as a profession, although the work as yet, lacking, as

674
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:58,680
it does, proper foundation in scientific truth, even though strongly

675
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:03,840
humanitarian in its motives, has still to prove itself acceptable among

676
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:08,400
the engineering groups. Structural engineering, on the contrary,

677
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:13,400
"belongs." Its work consists of the design and layout of modern steel

678
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:17,440
structures--this roughly--while the minor branch known as heating and

679
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:22,360
ventilating engineering, as its name would indicate, deals with the

680
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:26,760
proper heating and ventilating of buildings, and as a profession is

681
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:31,880
closely allied with that of structural engineering. Out of these minor

682
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:37,520
branches come yet other branches, more particularly groups, with each in

683
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:42,440
the nature of a specialty, such as gas engineering, aircraft

684
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:47,800
engineering, steam engineering, telephone engineering, and so on.

685
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:47,800


686
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:52,200
Students about to enter engineering colleges usually select one or

687
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:56,640
another of the major branches and then after graduating begin to

688
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:01,080
specialize. But infrequently Fate has much to do with this

689
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:06,200
specialization, since after leaving college the average young engineer

690
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:10,880
will turn to the nearest or most promising vacancy offered him in his

691
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,840
chosen field--a major branch--and in the work eventually become expert

692
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:21,480
and a specialist. If it be a concern manufacturing steam-turbines, say,

693
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:25,760
the young engineer in time becomes expert and a specialist in

694
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:32,160
steam-turbines. So, too, with graduates in mining engineering, in

695
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:37,400
electrical engineering, in civil engineering, although the opportunities

696
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:42,080
for specialization in any of these latter branches are not so good as in

697
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:48,200
the mechanical field. However, entering upon a certain kind of work, the

698
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:52,920
student usually follows this work to the end of his days, which is

699
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:58,280
probably what engineering schools expect. All strive to educate only in

700
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:03,000
the principles of each of the major branches. The rest is up to the

701
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:08,560
graduate, who is permitted, and generally does, the shaping of his own

702
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,120
career afterward.

703
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:10,160


704
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:15,120
It is a feature of our democratic form of government--thanks be! Germany

705
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:19,440
does--or did--the other thing. Germany made careers for her young men,

706
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:24,560
instead of young men for careers, with the result that she also made

707
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:30,320
machines out of them. America is a nation of individualists, which is

708
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:35,080
what makes America what it is, and our schools and school systems are

709
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,400
responsible.

710
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:36,400

00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,480
MAKING A CHOICE

717
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:38,480


718
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:38,480


719
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,640
About to make a choice among the branches of engineering, the

720
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:47,160
prospective student, unless he have a decided preference to start with,

721
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:52,240
finds himself confronted with many difficulties. Engineering is

722
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:56,840
engineering, whether it be mining or electrical or civil or mechanical,

723
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:02,480
and this fact alone is not without its confusions. Yet if the young man

724
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:08,040
decides for a mining career, say, the choice may take him, after

725
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:12,760
graduating, off to South Africa, whereas if his choice lay in the

726
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:17,560
electrical field he may never get any farther from home than the nearest

727
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:22,600
electrical manufacturing plant in his town or state--and remain there

728
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:27,520
for the duration of his life. This making of a choice is a momentous

729
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:32,120
thing in a prospective engineer's life. It should be approached with all

730
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:36,520
caution, and with due regard for the nature of the life he would lead

731
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:41,240
after graduating from school. If he have a penchant for outdoor life,

732
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:47,040
then the choice, in a way, is easy. He should select mining or civil

733
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:52,200
engineering as his particular vocation. If he be of those who prefer to

734
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:56,000
remain more or less indoors in the practice of his profession,

735
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
mechanical or electrical engineering should be his choice.

736
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,000


737
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,120
These are the major advantages or disadvantages, depending upon the

738
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:10,400
point of view. The minor ones are not so easily stated. Speaking always

739
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:15,080
for the young man without a decided preference, it is the writer's

740
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:19,360
opinion that the prospective student should analyze his particular

741
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:24,160
feelings in the matter and decide accordingly. Large projects may

742
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:29,040
interest him more than smaller ones. In this regard, he will

743
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:32,920
find greater satisfaction in following the profession dealing

744
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:38,440
with large projects, which is, of course, the civil engineering

745
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:43,360
profession--although mining, too, has its large ventures, which,

746
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:48,200
however, do not "break" as frequently as they do in civil engineering.

747
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:53,080
On the other hand, the young man may find himself attracted to the

748
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:57,760
development of small propositions, such as adding-machines and

749
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:03,000
typewriters and sewing-machines, and the like. Finding himself attracted

750
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,520
to these no less important phases of engineering than the development of

751
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:13,000
mines or the opening up of new country, the young man can, of course,

752
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,280
make no better choice than to enter the mechanical or the electrical

753
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,600
field.

754
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:18,600


755
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:23,320
It all depends upon the point of view. Nor is there any hard-and-fast

756
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:28,400
rule tying a man down to a single branch once he finds that he does not

757
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:33,840
like it, or finds that he likes one of the other branches better, after

758
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:37,960
he has given his chosen branch a trial in the years immediately

759
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:43,080
following graduation. Not a few mining graduates drift over into

760
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:49,240
straight civil work after leaving school, and, likewise, not a few in

761
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:53,720
the electrical branches find themselves in time pursuing mechanical

762
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:59,960
work. Fate here, as in the matter of specialization, works her hand. A

763
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:04,320
prominent publisher of technical magazines in New York took the degree

764
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:09,560
of Arts in Cornell in his younger days; and more writers of fiction than

765
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:14,160
you can shake a stick at once labored over civil-engineering plans as

766
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:19,560
their chosen career. Herbert Hoover is a mining man who best revealed

767
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:24,200
his capabilities in the field of traffic management--if the work which

768
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:29,640
he supervised in Belgium may be so termed. Certainly it had to do with

769
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:33,120
getting materials from where they were plentiful to where they were

770
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:37,280
scarce, which is roughly the work of the traffic manager.

771
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:37,280


772
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:42,000
And so it goes. The young man in this particular must decide for

773
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,600
himself. Actually, there is more of mystery and fascination in the

774
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:51,280
electrical field than in any of the other three branches, and to

775
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:56,000
prospective students this may be not without its especial appeal. To

776
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:01,200
others, the work of mining may possess its strong attraction, since this

777
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:06,200
work takes its followers into strange places and among strange people

778
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:10,880
frequently, where oftentimes the mining engineer must live cheek by

779
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:16,200
elbow with the roughest of adventurers. To yet a third group, civil

780
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:20,640
engineering, with its work of blazing new trails through an unknown

781
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:25,560
country, and wild outdoor existence through forests and over mountains

782
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:30,160
and across valleys--may have its strong attraction. While to a fourth

783
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:35,040
group of prospective students the quiet career, as represented in that

784
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:40,040
of mechanical engineering, always a more or less thoughtful, studious

785
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:45,720
life, may hold out its inviting side. The mechanical engineer, like the

786
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:51,400
electrical engineer, is a man who generally commutes, a man who comes

787
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:56,360
and goes daily between office and home, doing his work at regular hours

788
00:48:56,360 --> 00:49:01,600
within the four walls of his office--a quiet, professional man. Such a

789
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:05,760
life would appeal to the man of family rather more strongly than either

790
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:11,040
of the outdoor professional branches. Yet the prospective student must

791
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,960
make his own choice.

792
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:12,960


793
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:17,720
To the young man who has no particular preference, and who would put it

794
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:22,080
up to the writer as to just which branch to follow--the young man more

795
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:26,760
or less in need--the writer unhesitatingly would advise mechanical

796
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:31,280
engineering. It is the one branch offering the largest and quickest

797
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:37,160
returns, and as a branch it fairly dominates all the other branches, for

798
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:41,480
the reason that whereas the mechanical engineer can get along without

799
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:45,560
the mining engineer or the civil engineer or the electrical engineer,

800
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:50,120
neither the mining engineer nor the civil engineer nor the electrical

801
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:54,720
engineer can always do without the services of the mechanical engineer.

802
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:59,320
No other branch so overlaps the other branches as does mechanical

803
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:04,240
engineering. The work of the mechanical engineer is seen in almost every

804
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:09,280
piece of construction reared by the civil man, just as it is seen in

805
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:13,120
every bit of construction work of the mining and the electrical

806
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:18,440
engineers. At first glance this may not appear to be true, but a close

807
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:22,640
analysis of different jobs will bring out the truth of this statement.

808
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:22,640


809
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:28,480
Thus mechanical engineering offers largest and quickest returns. It does

810
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:32,760
this for another reason. Because of this very overlapping upon the

811
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:37,520
other three branches, for every position open in the electrical field,

812
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:42,280
or the mining or the civil field, there are a dozen vacancies in the

813
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:47,440
mechanical field. It cannot but be otherwise. Not one of the other

814
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:51,720
branches but what has need at times for--as I have stated--a mechanical

815
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:57,320
engineer. The casings and base-plates and supports of motors, for

816
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:01,920
instance, while the motor itself--its windings and the like--is the work

817
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:06,800
of the electrical engineer, are due to the designing genius of some

818
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:13,440
mechanical man. Likewise, in the mining field, where shaking screens, to

819
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:17,520
name only one of the many mechanical units necessary in mining

820
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:22,440
operations, are an essential factor--units operated with pulleys and

821
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:26,240
belts and cams and levers--all the province of the mechanical

822
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:31,080
engineer--the mechanical man finds his uses. So in civil work,

823
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:35,800
especially in dam construction where gates are necessary; and in

824
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:40,520
chemical engineering--to drop into a minor branch--where tanks and vats

825
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:46,040
and ovens and stirring paddles and the like are used. No matter in which

826
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:50,840
branch a man may go, always he will find evidence of the presence some

827
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:55,960
time of the mechanical engineer. The mechanical engineer dominates all

828
00:51:55,960 --> 00:52:01,440
the other branches, as has been said before. He is given second place

829
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:05,880
in the order of the branches merely because the civil engineer happened

830
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:10,840
to be the first and oldest kind of engineer to be given recognition as a

831
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:16,280
profession. This man made himself a professional man, just as did the

832
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:20,480
early practitioners of medicine--concocters of herbs in the beginning.

833
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:20,480


834
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:25,160
The proper selection will depend upon the young man's predilections and

835
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:30,720
tastes. If he selects wisely, following out his predilections and tastes

836
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:36,800
with a degree of accuracy, he cannot go wrong. He cannot go far wrong

837
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:41,880
even if he doesn't follow out his hunches, for the reason that he can

838
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:46,280
always swing over into any one of the other branches whenever he sees

839
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:51,680
fit to do so. The thing is done every day, and will continue to be done

840
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:57,280
throughout all time. Merely, it would be well for the young man, of

841
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:01,840
course, to select in the beginning that branch which most appeals to

842
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:08,000
him, and to stick to it like glue. Success is certain to be his. For in

843
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,360
no other walk of life are the rewards so sure and so ample and so

844
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:17,840
immediately responsive as in the engineering professions. These--like

845
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:21,800
the matter of his selection from among the four major branches--are

846
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:25,000
solely a matter up to the individual.

847
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:25,000


848
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:25,040


849
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:25,040


850
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:25,080


851
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:25,800
VI

852
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:25,800


853
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,760
QUALIFYING FOR PROMOTION

854
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:27,800


855
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:27,880


856
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:32,440
Immediately upon graduating--indeed, often several months before

857
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:36,720
graduating--the engineering student finds his first job awaiting him.

858
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:41,400
Frequently he finds a number of first jobs awaiting him and must make a

859
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:46,800
selection. For it is the custom with large manufacturing concerns to

860
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:50,840
send out scouts in the early spring of each year to address the

861
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:55,960
engineering student bodies, with the idea in mind of securing the

862
00:53:55,960 --> 00:54:00,360
services of as many graduates as the scouts can win over for their

863
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:05,840
respective organizations through direct appeal. What is usually offered

864
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:10,280
the coming graduate is a brief apprenticeship in the shop, at a living

865
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:15,440
wage, with promise of as early and rapid promotion in the organization

866
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:19,640
as the work of the apprentice himself will permit, or improves.

867
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:19,640


868
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:24,680
These offers are generally splendid opportunities. The graduate may

869
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:28,760
learn much of a practical commercial nature which perforce has been

870
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:34,200
denied him in his student days, and also, having entered upon this

871
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:39,160
apprenticeship, he not only gets acquainted with production on a large

872
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:43,800
scale, but he is brought into touch with what constitutes most recent

873
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:49,040
acceptable practice as well. This, provided he be a mechanical or an

874
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:54,720
electrical engineer. Graduates in civil and mining engineering, while

875
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:58,880
offered positions from executives in these particular branches also,

876
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:04,600
have no such large opportunities offered them. The work itself does not

877
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:09,800
permit it. Yet in any of the branches there is never a scarcity of jobs

878
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:13,280
open to graduates upon their leaving college.

879
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:13,480


880
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:18,000
To qualify for promotion in any work, but more especially in the

881
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:23,240
professions, one must know one's business. That is a trite statement,

882
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:28,280
but it will bear repeating. The young graduate at first will not know

883
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:33,480
his business. His mind will be a chaos of theories based upon myriads of

884
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:38,920
formulæ which cannot but confuse him in the early days, when he is most

885
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:43,160
earnestly trying to apply one or more of them to the more or less petty

886
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:47,400
tasks which will be assigned to him. All he can do under the

887
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:52,400
circumstances--all anybody could do under the circumstances--is to wait

888
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:57,360
patiently, the while doing the best he can. Problems have a way of

889
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:02,160
working themselves out--the correct formula will present itself; its

890
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:06,760
true application will become manifest--and thus the young engineer has

891
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:11,160
learned something of a practical nature which need not forsake him

892
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:14,480
throughout the remainder of his engineering career.

893
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:14,480


894
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:19,200
Engineers are especially tolerant of one another's mistakes and errors.

895
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:24,480
They are much more so than medical men, for instance. In the field of

896
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:28,560
medicine one must show by many practical cases wherein a certain

897
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:33,200
treatment has proved effective before the fraternity at large will even

898
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:37,920
give the practitioner a hearing. This is not so among engineers.

899
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:42,640
Engineers turn to one another in difficulties with earnest desire to

900
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:47,320
help if they can help; and when one of their number is in trouble in his

901
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:51,640
efforts to solve a difficult problem the whole body will turn to him

902
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:57,320
with friendly encouragement and advice, if the latter is wanted. The

903
00:56:57,320 --> 00:57:01,480
young graduate who is struggling with a problem come up in his daily

904
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:07,000
work, if he will but make the fact known to the engineers on the job in

905
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:12,400
association with him, will find himself surrounded by engineers every

906
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:16,600
one of whom will be seriously concerned for him and anxious to render

907
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,120
assistance.

908
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:18,120


909
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:22,840
So the young graduate need entertain no fears on the ground of possible

910
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:28,640
errors when starting out. Merely he must go slow; take his own good

911
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:33,520
time on a job; ask all the questions possible of his engineer neighbors.

912
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:39,240
Frankness in engineering, as in any other walk of life, pays. The

913
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:44,680
bluffer is not wanted. No man knows it all, and certainly no engineer

914
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:48,840
knows all there is to know about his profession. Time was when this

915
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:53,440
might have been true; but it isn't true to-day. The work of engineering

916
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:58,120
research and development has become so complex that engineers are forced

917
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:03,400
to specialize. The engineering graduate, entering upon his first job,

918
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:09,360
will discover early that he, too, must specialize. This will not be

919
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:13,120
difficult, owing to the fact that his engineering education has been

920
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:18,400
general and designed to embrace in a liberal way all practice. Drawing,

921
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:23,040
as he will, from this liberal source that which he finds necessary in

922
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:28,080
the solving of his initial problems, he will find himself within a short

923
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:31,840
time becoming, willy-nilly, a specialist.

924
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:31,880


925
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:36,080
In the earlier years there should be considerable study done after hours

926
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:41,080
on the part of the graduate engineer. Because his education has been

927
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:45,480
general in the field, and he now holds a position with a company

928
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:51,560
manufacturing steam-turbines, say, he must "wise up," as the saying

929
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:57,200
goes, on the subject of steam-turbines. It will do him no harm to trace

930
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:01,760
back to its source all progress made in the field of turbine engineering

931
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:07,480
and construction. He will find no scarcity of books on the subject, and

932
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:11,760
with every hour spent with these volumes he will become more valuable to

933
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:17,640
the organization employing him. Likewise, if he find himself working for

934
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:22,280
an electrical manufacturing concern, and himself a graduate in

935
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:28,120
electrical engineering, if the product be only a single line, and so

936
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:32,800
small a thing as spark-plugs, it will profit him greatly to read

937
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:37,440
whatever has been printed on the subject of spark-plugs. So with the

938
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:41,320
mining graduate in the matter of the different processes of recovering

939
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:46,760
minerals; so with the civil graduate, especially in the concrete field

940
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:51,840
of construction, which has made rapid strides in the past few years--the

941
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:56,280
graduate should absorb as much as he can of the available works printed

942
00:59:56,280 --> 01:00:01,720
on the subject. Indeed, this is the profession of it, in that the

943
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:06,040
practitioner must ever be alive and alert to what is being done and has

944
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:10,440
been done from the beginning in his chosen line of endeavor.

945
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:10,440


946
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:15,400
Next must come fealty. The graduate on his first job must believe--and

947
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:19,440
if he does not believe ought to change connections--that the product of

948
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:24,640
his company is the best in the market. This need not necessarily be

949
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:29,640
true; but he must feel that it is true. For only in this way can he put

950
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:34,560
the best that is in him into his work. Industry--and the engineer is the

951
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:39,920
backbone of industry--is a hotbed of competition. Any organization needs

952
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:45,320
all the enthusiasm it can get. Greatest enthusiasm of all must come from

953
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:50,160
within its own circles. Lacking this enthusiasm within its own family,

954
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:55,520
the organization as a whole suffers. The graduate must first of all

955
01:00:55,520 --> 01:01:00,480
supply enthusiasm to the source of his employment, because at first he

956
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:05,680
can supply but very little else. He must be true to his trust in ways

957
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:10,160
other than the mere doing of what he is told or producing what he is

958
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:15,360
expected to produce. This attitude cannot but help him qualify for

959
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:21,160
promotion, and rapidly. It is a very important factor in any engineer's

960
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:22,560
advancement.

961
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:22,560


962
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:26,760
Then there is the matter of patience. The writer knows of no other

963
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:32,400
qualification more fruitful of reward than patience. The word control is

964
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:37,520
frequently used in this regard--self-control. Its other name, however,

965
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:42,080
is patience--the thing that gives a man to try and try again until he

966
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:47,680
succeeds. Engineering is a difficult profession, though not more

967
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:51,840
difficult than other professions, and in the average engineer's

968
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:57,000
working-day many things occur which, if he be not possessed of infinite

969
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:02,640
patience, will serve to try him to a considerable degree. Patience with

970
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:06,240
those below him--patience with those above him--patience with

971
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:10,440
himself--these are all necessary and will prove helpful to him in

972
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:15,680
reaching the top. He must accept the petty tasks with a cheerfulness no

973
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:20,800
less apparent than he accepts the more important ones. He must present

974
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:26,360
his own ideas to his superiors with a degree of caution which, where the

975
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:30,960
ideas are rejected, will yet permit him to withdraw within himself

976
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:35,720
without giving the impression of being peeved. For engineering is above

977
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:39,880
all other things the interchange of ideas among men having an equal

978
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:46,080
training but a vastly different quality of experience. Men of diverse

979
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:50,440
experience thus drawn together make for a balanced engineering staff,

980
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:55,560
and a balanced engineering staff makes for a well-organized whole. The

981
01:02:55,560 --> 01:03:00,080
young engineer must conduct himself in such a way that his superiors

982
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:06,160
will like him for what he is, as indicated by his personality, rather

983
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:09,000
than for what he knows or does in his daily work.

984
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:09,040


985
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:14,480
To sum up, then, the young engineer, having entered upon his first job,

986
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:19,520
must do three or four things in order quickly to qualify for promotion.

987
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:24,200
He first of all must spend time in study after his day's work is

988
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:28,880
done--absorb all information having to do with the company's own

989
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:33,400
product; hold himself ever alert to the company's own methods of

990
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:38,280
production; watch for an opportunity whereby this production may be

991
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:43,240
improved upon or the methods of production themselves improved upon. The

992
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:48,640
young engineer must proceed slowly in everything he undertakes; when

993
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:52,680
brought to a halt through difficulties he should instantly appeal to one

994
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:58,520
or another of his associates or superiors; he must be absolutely frank

995
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:03,720
in all his dealings with these associates and superiors. In this regard,

996
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:09,160
also, it might be said that the young graduate, following a habit become

997
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:14,240
almost second nature with him in his school-days, must keep a note-book

998
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:19,040
covering his activities throughout each working-day, a book wherein he

999
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:23,120
will jot down everything of value to him which comes up in the day's

1000
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:28,800
work. Such books often form the basis of complete text-books in after

1001
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:34,800
years, and, indeed, are acknowledged to be the foundation of more than

1002
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:40,120
one recognized authority. Though in this regard, further, such a

1003
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:45,080
practice is sometimes discouraged in some organizations, since it is

1004
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:48,960
apparent that these note-books often contain facts which the

1005
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:54,280
organization does not wish to have made public, being, as these notes

1006
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:59,800
often are, in the nature of trade secrets. However, the student with a

1007
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:03,360
conscience will effectively guard the secrets of his employer as

1008
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:08,760
contained in his note-book, holding its contents for his own use in

1009
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:12,200
furthering the interests of the company which employs him.

1010
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:12,240


1011
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:16,520
And finally--in the matter of personality--patience and regard for the

1012
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:21,600
foibles of others will go far toward advancing the young engineer toward

1013
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:27,320
success. He must never forget in his earlier years that he is embryonic

1014
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:31,720
in the profession; that the profession is a difficult one and with many

1015
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:36,760
ramifications; that if he was able to live through three normal lives he

1016
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:41,360
would yet know only a very little of what there is to know about his

1017
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:46,640
chosen work. Thus he will conduct himself in a manner designed to win

1018
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:51,960
the interest and affection of men who are superior to him. Life to-day

1019
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:57,000
consists more than ever of service, and no man can go the path alone.

1020
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:02,480
Service--assistance one to another--makes up the sum total of life. No

1021
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:07,400
engineering graduate--no young man in any walk of life--can progress far

1022
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:13,160
without assistance, however brilliant as a student and capable as a man

1023
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:17,400
he may be. If he will but bear this last in mind--this and the other

1024
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:22,000
even more important truth, that as a man gives so shall he

1025
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:26,360
receive--that a dollar spent in charity means two dollars in the bank--I

1026
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:30,800
mean that exactly--then the heights themselves will beckon to him at an

1027
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:32,440
early age.

1028
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:32,440


1029
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:37,000
"Early to bed and early to rise"; "take care of the pennies and the

1030
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:41,600
dollars will take care of themselves"; "a bird in the hand is worth two

1031
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:45,360
in the bush"--we don't need--the engineering graduate does not

1032
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:51,440
need--that form of admonition. It means nothing and is false. What alone

1033
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:55,200
counts for success is a considerable regard for the rights and

1034
01:06:55,200 --> 01:07:00,280
privileges of others, the unfortunate as well as the fortunate. Greed

1035
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:05,000
never brought success that was lasting to any one, and certainly it

1036
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:09,320
breeds unhappiness. Engineering is a work of service--service to

1037
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:13,920
others--and to the graduate who "gets" this truism will come all things

1038
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:18,760
of this life, not the least of which will be material rewards.

1039
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:18,800


1040
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:18,800


1041
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:18,800


1042
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:18,800


1043
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:19,880
VII

1044
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:19,880


1045
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:21,640
THE CONSULTING ENGINEER

1046
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:21,640


1047
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:21,680


1048
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:26,240
The consulting engineer represents the pinnacle, as it were, of

1049
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:30,840
professional success. The inventor is something else--a wilding in the

1050
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:35,120
profession--and as such cannot be considered in a paper of this kind,

1051
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:40,520
save only as to say that he is the presiding genius among engineers, the

1052
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:46,120
Shakespeare or Milton among his kind, a man whose path to the heights is

1053
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:50,920
nowhere known of men. The consulting engineer, on the contrary,

1054
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:56,280
representing, as he does, the zenith of slowly attained power in some

1055
01:07:56,280 --> 01:08:01,840
certain branch of engineering, a vantage--point open freely to all, is

1056
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:06,080
the embodiment of the goal toward which all graduates should strive. The

1057
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:11,720
consulting engineer has perfected himself in his chosen field; he has

1058
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:16,960
become an authority in his branch of engineering; his word is accepted

1059
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:21,600
as final in court and privy council. Having gained to this enviable

1060
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:26,520
position only after prolonged study and protracted and wide experience

1061
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:31,600
in his particular specialty, the consulting engineer has well earned

1062
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:37,360
whatever accrues to him in the way, among other things, of generous fees

1063
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:38,720
for his services.

1064
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:38,720


1065
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:43,080
Still, there are consulting engineers who have become so through

1066
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:47,920
accident. The writer personally knows a consulting engineer who was

1067
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:52,520
following a general engineering practice when called upon one day to

1068
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:57,480
advise a group of capitalists in the matter of a garbage-disposal plant

1069
01:08:57,480 --> 01:09:03,320
of new design for a large mid-Western city. His services were sought not

1070
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:08,240
because he was a garbage expert, but rather because he was expert in

1071
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:13,760
intricate pipe layouts and the like. However, once he got his hand into

1072
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:18,640
garbage disposition on a large scale, he remained in this branch of

1073
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:23,200
engineering, eventually traveling about the country supervising the

1074
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:27,800
design of similar plants whose object was the economical disposal of

1075
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:33,400
municipal refuse. Practically alone in the field, his writings soon

1076
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:37,840
became accepted as authoritative, and yet the whole thing began with

1077
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:42,840
that first call, quite by chance, in a matter foreign to the subject.

1078
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:47,920
Like other professional men, engineers never know when the heavens will

1079
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:50,240
open for their particular benefit.

1080
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:50,360


1081
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:55,240
Yet these cases are rare. The average consulting engineer is a man who

1082
01:09:55,240 --> 01:10:00,240
has won to pre-eminence only through protracted study and hard work in

1083
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:05,720
one line. He is a specialist with a high reputation for accuracy and

1084
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:11,880
skill in that line. The basis of this skill, of course, lies in a broad

1085
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:17,160
general engineering experience, upon which is built a peculiar knowledge

1086
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:22,200
of a certain, and not infrequently isolated, branch of engineering.

1087
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:26,360
Heating and ventilating engineers are but specialists grown to such

1088
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:31,240
large numbers as to form a definite branch of engineering. Likewise,

1089
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:36,040
automotive engineers are men who have specialized through long years in

1090
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:41,920
this branch. The man who knows more about building dredges, say, than

1091
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:46,360
any other man among his engineering brothers is a man who will be most

1092
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:50,720
frequently sought by industrial powers feeling the need for a dredge,

1093
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:55,360
just as a man suffering eye-strain will seek out the best specialist

1094
01:10:55,360 --> 01:11:00,240
known to the medical fraternity. He goes to the one acknowledged

1095
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:04,680
authority in this line, and in doing so but follows a sane inner

1096
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:05,880
dictation.

1097
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:05,920


1098
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:10,480
And that is consulting work. The individual of money who would launch

1099
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:16,240
into manufacturing, knowing nothing of manufacturing, will, after

1100
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:20,400
deciding as to which branch of manufacturing he wishes to follow,

1101
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:25,560
enlist the services of a consulting engineer big by reputation in this

1102
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:31,360
branch. The capitalist may wish to enter the paper-manufacturing field.

1103
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:35,400
Straightway he will put himself in touch with a consulting engineer

1104
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:41,440
whose specialty is paper-manufacturing plants, and, having informed this

1105
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:45,320
man as to the amount of money he is willing to spend on the venture,

1106
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:50,840
together with the location where he wishes, within certain prescribed

1107
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:56,680
limitations, to have his plant stand, may withdraw from the thing, if he

1108
01:11:56,680 --> 01:12:01,440
choose, until the plant is built and in operation. The consulting

1109
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:07,040
engineer has done the rest. He has gone out upon location, seeking sites

1110
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:11,960
with an eye to economy both of power and transportation; he has

1111
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:16,280
supervised the design of the plant and the location in the plant of the

1112
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:21,800
necessary machinery; has enlisted the service of a builder whose task it

1113
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:26,320
is to follow these plans from foundation to roof in the work of actual

1114
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:31,080
construction. For this work the consulting engineer receives a fee,

1115
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:36,280
usually based upon a percentage of the cost, and then turns to other

1116
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:40,920
clients--waiting in his outer office--who would enlist his services in a

1117
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:43,000
similar capacity.

1118
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:43,040


1119
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:47,320
The consulting engineer has other sources of revenue. Like the lawyer,

1120
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:51,600
he is frequently retained by traction and lighting interests to guard

1121
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:56,480
the rights of these interests, service for which he receives payment by

1122
01:12:56,480 --> 01:13:02,200
the year. His testimony is valued in matters of litigation, sometimes

1123
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:07,560
patent infringements, sometimes municipal warfare between corporations,

1124
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:13,400
but always of a highly specialized nature. He is an authority, and when

1125
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:18,680
I have said that I have said all. His retainer fees are large; his work

1126
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:23,440
is exact; he is a man looked up to by those in the profession following

1127
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:29,200
a general practice. He has his office, and retains a staff of engineers,

1128
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:35,120
usually young engineers just out of college, who, like himself at one

1129
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:39,920
time, are on their way upward in the game. He is rarely a young man;

1130
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:45,480
generally is a man of wide reading; is a man respected in his community

1131
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:50,160
not for what he knows as an engineer, but for the standard of living

1132
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:55,080
which he is able to set by virtue of his income. Besides the sources of

1133
01:13:55,080 --> 01:14:00,120
revenue which are his, and as I have set forth above, he is sought by

1134
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:04,960
technical editors to contribute to magazines powerful in his field, and

1135
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:09,760
this is a pleasurable source of income to any man in any walk of life.

1136
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:14,720
The consulting engineer is a man to be admired and emulated by all

1137
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:16,880
engineering students.

1138
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:16,880


1139
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:21,200
As to the time in life when an engineer feels qualified to enter upon

1140
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:25,960
consulting work, that is something which must come to him from within.

1141
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:30,760
Usually the engineer knows that he has become a factor in his chosen

1142
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:35,440
branch or specialty when he finds himself becoming more and more sought

1143
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:41,360
in an advisory capacity among his fellows. He can judge that he has

1144
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:45,960
become an authority in his work by the simple process of comparing

1145
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:50,080
himself and his work with others and the work of these others in the

1146
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:55,120
field. If he finds that he is designing a better plant or automatic

1147
01:14:55,120 --> 01:15:00,760
machine, or more economically operated mine or more serviceable lighting

1148
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:06,200
station than his neighbor, and, together with this knowledge, perceives

1149
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:10,640
also that capitalists are beating a deeper path to his door than to the

1150
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:15,120
doors of his competitors--to warp an Emersonian phrase--then the

1151
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:18,800
handwriting on the wall should be clear to him--to quote the Bible.

1152
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:23,640
Having sufficient capital to carry him through a year or two of personal

1153
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:28,920
venturing in the consulting field, he will open an office and insert his

1154
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:34,320
professional card in the journals in his field--and fly to it. If he be

1155
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:39,400
a man of righteous parts, he will succeed as a consulting engineer--and

1156
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:41,720
can go no higher in the profession.

1157
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:41,760


1158
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:44,120
The game is certainly worth the candle.

1159
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:44,160


1160
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:44,160


1161
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:44,240


1162
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:44,240


1163
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:45,160
VIII

1164
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:45,160


1165
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:47,440
THE ENGINEER IN CIVIC AFFAIRS

1166
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:47,440


1167
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:47,440


1168
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:52,000
Much has been written of late of the engineer as a citizen--of his civic

1169
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:58,400
responsibilities, of his relation to legislation, to administration, to

1170
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:03,560
public opinion, and the like. It is timely writing. The engineer is

1171
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:08,480
about due for active participation in civic affairs other than a yearly

1172
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:14,120
visit to the polls to register his vote. He has not done much more than

1173
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:19,560
this since his inception. His work alone has sufficed, for him, at

1174
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:24,160
least, though the time is past when he can bury himself in his

1175
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:29,640
professional work and, in the vernacular, get away with it. Men of the

1176
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:34,360
stamp of Herbert Hoover have demonstrated the very great need for men of

1177
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:39,720
scientific training in public affairs. Such places heretofore have been

1178
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:44,880
filled with business men and lawyers. These men served and served well.

1179
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:49,520
But since administration of public affairs to-day is largely a matter of

1180
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:55,160
formulation and execution of engineering projects, it is assuredly the

1181
01:16:55,160 --> 01:16:59,240
duty of engineers to take an active part in these public affairs.

1182
01:16:59,240 --> 01:16:59,240


1183
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:04,240
Exact knowledge, which in a manner of speaking is synonymous with the

1184
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:09,360
engineer, is needed in high places in our nation. Men of technical

1185
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:13,680
education and training have demonstrated their fitness as servants of

1186
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:18,120
the people in the few instances where such men have taken over the reins

1187
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:22,840
of administration in certain specified branches of our government.

1188
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:26,800
Trained to think in terms of figures and the relation of these figures

1189
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:32,480
to life, engineers readily perceive the true and the untrue in matters

1190
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:37,200
of legislation and administration, though as a body they have never

1191
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:42,000
exerted themselves to an expression of their opinions on matters coming

1192
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:46,880
properly under the head of public opinion. Engineers have felt that they

1193
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:52,280
have not had the time. Or, having the time, that the public at large,

1194
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:57,600
chiefly owing to the engineer's self-imposed isolation, would not

1195
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:02,640
understand a voice from this direction, and so engineers have kept

1196
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:07,880
silent. The day has arrived, however, when this silence on the part of

1197
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:09,920
engineers must be broken.

1198
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:09,920


1199
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:13,920
The World War has been an awakening in this as in other directions.

1200
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:19,080
Lawyers and politicians have successfully dominated our government from

1201
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:24,040
its beginning, with a single beautiful exception in George Washington at

1202
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:28,600
one end and another admirable exception in Woodrow Wilson at the other.

1203
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:34,200
Washington was a civil engineer, and Wilson, while trained as a lawyer,

1204
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:39,160
was an educator. In between these two men there may have fallen a

1205
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:44,000
scattering of others who were not lawyers or politicians; the writer is

1206
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:49,920
not sure. Of one thing he is sure, however, and that is that engineers

1207
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:54,400
in the future will dominate politics to the betterment of the nation as

1208
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:59,600
a whole. For engineers are idealists--otherwise they would never have

1209
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:04,520
entered upon an engineering career--and idealism has come, as it were,

1210
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:09,800
into its own again. The man of vision of a wholesome aspect, the man who

1211
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:14,560
can so completely forget himself in his work of service as to engage in

1212
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:19,880
tasks whose merits nobody save himself and those pursuing like tasks can

1213
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:25,320
or will understand--which is pre-eminently the engineer--is the one man

1214
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:30,960
best fitted to administrate in public affairs. More important still than

1215
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:34,640
this statement is the fact that the world at large is beginning to

1216
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:40,320
realize the truth of it. Engineers as a body stand poised upon the rim

1217
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:45,440
of big things. Nor will they as a body stoop to the petty in politics,

1218
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:50,440
once they are fairly well launched in active participation of civic

1219
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:55,240
affairs. Neither their training nor their outlook, based upon their

1220
01:19:55,240 --> 01:20:00,320
training, will permit it. For engineers, more than any other group of

1221
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:06,200
professional men, are given to "see true." And seeing true, being, as it

1222
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:10,720
is, the essence of a full life, is what is needed in our public

1223
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:12,320
administrators.

1224
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:12,320


1225
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:16,200
Engineers in the past who have become more or less prominent in the

1226
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:20,280
public eye--and there are some who have--have demonstrated their ability

1227
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:25,520
to see things as they are. Westinghouse was the first man in this

1228
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:29,600
country to foresee the coming of the half-holiday Saturday as an

1229
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:34,840
innovation that promised general adoption. He granted it to all his

1230
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:40,000
employees at a time when lesser industrial captains believed him to be

1231
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:45,520
at least "queer." Ford set the pace for a minimum rate of five dollars a

1232
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:50,920
day in his plant, and lesser captains still frown upon him for having

1233
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:56,320
perpetrated this "evil." Edison, among other things, has told of the

1234
01:20:56,320 --> 01:21:00,600
importance of loose clothing--loose shoes and collars and hats--to a man

1235
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:06,240
who would enjoy good health. The list is not long, but the insight of

1236
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:11,080
those who form this short list cannot but be recognized. What these men

1237
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:15,440
have said and done concerning matters freely apart from the subject of

1238
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:20,320
engineering reveals them as members of a fraternity well qualified to

1239
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:25,200
lead public opinion rather than to follow it, as has been the province

1240
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:30,080
of engineers in the past. Each when he has spoken or entered upon action

1241
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:35,040
having the public welfare in mind has pronounced or demonstrated a truth

1242
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:37,920
which fairly crackled with sanity.

1243
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:37,920


1244
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:43,320
Engineers belong in civic affairs. The world of humanity needs men of

1245
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:48,920
their stamp in high places. Humanity needs men in control of state and

1246
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:53,080
national affairs who would hold the interests of humanity sacred.

1247
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:57,600
Engineers are such men. Not that engineers more than any other

1248
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:02,680
professional men are sprouting wings--not that. But engineers do see

1249
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:06,560
things in their true light--cannot see them in any other light than the

1250
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:11,600
one imposed by the law of mathematics, which is that two and two make

1251
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:16,200
four, never five or three--and this involuntarily would admit of

1252
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:20,200
decisions and grant graces from the point of view of absolute truth,

1253
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:25,840
which is, of course, the point of view of humanity--the greatest good

1254
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:30,360
for the greatest number. With such men occupying high places in the

1255
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:35,040
nation's affairs, the world of men and mankind would leap forward

1256
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:39,200
ethically and spiritually at a pace in keeping with the pace at which

1257
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:44,320
civilization has progressed under the impetus of engineering thought

1258
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:50,960
since the days of Watt. Nobody can deny _that_ progress. Nobody could

1259
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:55,200
well deny the fact that ethical progress under engineering guidance

1260
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:57,080
would be equally great.

1261
01:22:57,080 --> 01:22:57,080


1262
01:22:57,080 --> 01:23:02,640
I hold a brief for engineers, of course. Engineering has been my major

1263
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:07,520
work for twenty years and more. It has been my privilege to associate

1264
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:12,240
intimately with two men--yea, three--possessed of great engineering

1265
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:17,840
ability. The third man failed of great repute, owing chiefly to his

1266
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:23,000
advanced--rather too much advanced--visionings. He wanted to talk across

1267
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:27,520
the ocean by telephone at a time when the cable interests successfully

1268
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:32,600
prevented him from commercializing his apparatus. And he died a

1269
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:37,240
disappointed inventor. But he had the stuff in him, the thing that makes

1270
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:42,200
for human greatness, just as had the other and more successful two men

1271
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:47,520
with whom I as a designer was privileged to work. All were men of kindly

1272
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:53,040
spirit, of broad outlook, of unselfish devotion to worldly interests.

1273
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:58,440
Each was a humanitarian. Each saw things as they are, and each saw

1274
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:02,560
things as they should be, and each thought much on problems of human

1275
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:07,800
welfare and betterment. Of such men in civic affairs the nation, and

1276
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:13,120
indeed the entire world of nations, has had but a sad too few in the

1277
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:17,840
past. It is to be hoped, and it is the belief of the writer, that

1278
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:21,880
engineers will become more plentiful in civic life in the future.

1279
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:21,880


1280
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:26,160
I have always believed that the man who reached an advanced age without

1281
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:31,040
a sizable bank-account is a fact which would well serve as a definition

1282
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:36,280
as to what constitutes an idealist. There are many such men--meaning, of

1283
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:42,560
course, men having a level set of brains, and not mental incompetents.

1284
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:46,480
Such men are inclined to things other than the accumulation of

1285
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:50,920
bank-accounts. They strive toward goals which to them are more worth

1286
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:56,400
while--self-improvement, for instance, spiritual growth being a better

1287
01:24:56,400 --> 01:25:02,040
term. Of such men were the world's acknowledged saviors. A man who can

1288
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:05,880
wilfully thrust oars against the current of a stream flowing

1289
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:10,760
currency-wise, in such a way as to force himself into a back eddy or

1290
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:16,880
pool more or less stagnant, is a man pronouncedly great among men. The

1291
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:22,560
world is loath to recognize such a man for what he is; yet such men have

1292
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:27,080
lived and still live and will continue to live, always more for others

1293
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:31,720
than for themselves--seeing life in the true, in other and more gracious

1294
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:32,880
words.

1295
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:32,880


1296
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:38,680
Engineers, in the abstract, are such men. The accumulation of money is

1297
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:43,320
secondary with them. Their work holds first place in importance.

1298
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:47,880
Possessed of that professional pride which will not permit a man to set

1299
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:52,840
aside his work and enter a more lucrative and materially satisfactory

1300
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:57,240
field of endeavor--if he starve in his obstinacy--engineers are men of

1301
01:25:57,240 --> 01:26:02,600
the temperament, aside from the training, to minister to public needs

1302
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:08,200
and desires. Self-effacement is the engineer's chief characteristic. He

1303
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:12,880
views largely and without bias. He can see things from the other

1304
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:17,320
fellow's angle because he is not an engineer if he has not the gift of

1305
01:26:17,320 --> 01:26:22,240
imagination. The successful engineer has this most precious of

1306
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:28,080
endowments, and, having it, cannot but be possessed also of kindliness

1307
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:33,240
and sympathy, which are imagination's own brothers. Kindliness and

1308
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:37,520
sympathy are needed in the high places of our government for the people

1309
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:42,160
by the people. And because men in time gravitate to their rightful

1310
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:46,320
sphere of usefulness through the workings of an all-wise Providence,

1311
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:50,800
engineers already have turned and are turning toward the administration

1312
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:52,320
of public affairs.

1313
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:52,320


1314
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:52,320


1315
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:52,320


1316
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:52,360


1317
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:53,240
IX

1318
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:53,240


1319
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:54,400
CODE OF ETHICS

1320
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:54,480


1321
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:54,520


1322
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:58,760
All engineering societies have a code of ethics for the guidance of

1323
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:04,240
their membership bodies. In each case it is a code based upon other and

1324
01:27:04,240 --> 01:27:09,680
older codes, codes long in practice among professional men, such as

1325
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:15,000
lawyers and doctors. It is a code built up on Christian principles, as

1326
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:20,200
it should be, and rarely is it ignored among men of the profession. To

1327
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:24,600
do unto others as you would have others do unto you is the basis of its

1328
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:30,000
precepts, though more concretely it aims to guide the engineer in his

1329
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:34,160
business intercourse with other men in such a way as to give all an

1330
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:39,520
equal chance without transgressing the law. The so-called building codes

1331
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:44,320
in effect in large cities are intended to hold engineers to restrictions

1332
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:49,200
for the greatest good of the greatest number, and the code of ethics in

1333
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:53,920
practice among each of the engineering professions likewise was devised

1334
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:57,280
toward this end. There seems to be need for it.

1335
01:27:57,280 --> 01:27:57,280


1336
01:27:57,280 --> 01:28:02,240
Perhaps by pointing out where engineers sometimes transgress, the

1337
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:06,240
writer more effectively can indicate the need of a code and the

1338
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:12,320
principles of which the engineering code of ethics consists. Even to-day

1339
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:16,200
there are engineers digressing from the path indicated by the

1340
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:20,480
professional body, though in such a way as to benefit still by the

1341
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:25,280
protection of the law, and to be not openly susceptible to admonition

1342
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:30,560
from the engineering societies' committees. Engineers of this stamp at

1343
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:34,960
best are but tricksters. Actually, they should be debarred from

1344
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:39,880
practice, just as the legal fraternity takes effective action against

1345
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:44,920
members of the bar who go outside the pale, though nothing is ever done

1346
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:50,160
to engineers. Engineering organizations in this regard are weak. The

1347
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:55,680
man's name should at least be posted, or, better still, published in the

1348
01:28:55,680 --> 01:29:00,280
society's bulletin, so that the fraternity at large could know, and,

1349
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:05,400
knowing, could warn men with capital to invest--the trickster's especial

1350
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:07,480
prey--for its own welfare.

1351
01:29:07,480 --> 01:29:07,520


1352
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:11,160
There was an engineer brought to the attention of the writer whose

1353
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:16,600
activities were devoted to securing for his clients men of no mechanical

1354
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:22,560
knowledge who yet wanted something done by machinery. A manufacturer of

1355
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:28,000
paper dolls, say, having entered upon this phase of manufacturing only

1356
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:32,120
because he had money to invest and not because he was interested in

1357
01:29:32,120 --> 01:29:37,080
mechanics, would see the need in his plant for additional mechanical

1358
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:42,440
devices to cut down manufacturing costs. The engineer to whom I have

1359
01:29:42,440 --> 01:29:47,480
reference would find this type of manufacturer his particular "meat,"

1360
01:29:47,480 --> 01:29:53,160
because of the man's ignorance of mechanics, and, after clinching him

1361
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:58,040
with a contract drawn up by the engineer's lawyer, would undertake to

1362
01:29:58,040 --> 01:30:03,160
devise for this manufacturer a perpetual-motion machine, if that

1363
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:07,920
happened to be what the manufacturer wanted. The engineer conducted a

1364
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:12,880
machine-shop in connection with his "consulting" office, where, at a

1365
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:18,320
dollar an hour for the use of his machine-tools, he would "develop" his

1366
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:23,160
ideas, as passed upon by the manufacturer who knew no more of

1367
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:26,920
construction or the reading of mechanical drawings than he did of the

1368
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:32,080
chicanery of the engineer, and in this way roll up the costs against the

1369
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:36,480
unfortunate. In the end the engineer might and might not produce a

1370
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:41,240
satisfactory working machine. There was nothing in the contract about

1371
01:30:41,240 --> 01:30:46,200
this--save only as it protected the engineer. What was indeed produced

1372
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:50,720
was a list of costs for the development often of several designs of a

1373
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:54,320
given idea that to say the least were heartrending.

1374
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:54,320


1375
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:58,120
Then there is the engineer who for a consideration will bear false

1376
01:30:58,120 --> 01:31:04,000
testimony against his neighbor, or his neighbor's ox. This happens most

1377
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:09,600
frequently in municipal traction or lighting wars, set before tribunals

1378
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:16,520
under the caption of "The People _vs._ the S. S. Street Railway

1379
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:21,960
Company," or in a battle of alleged infringement of patent rights. There

1380
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:27,560
are engineering experts, just as there are legal experts, who deem it

1381
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:31,240
within their code of ethics to address themselves and their energies

1382
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:36,840
toward the refutation of such claims, however wrong or right these

1383
01:31:36,840 --> 01:31:41,960
claims may be. Engineering is an exact science. It is based on

1384
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:46,560
principles hardly refutable. Yet there are engineers who will and can

1385
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:51,400
confound these principles before a court of law in such manner as to win

1386
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:56,400
for their clients a decision of non-suit where the facts point glaringly

1387
01:31:56,400 --> 01:32:01,360
to infringement--in the matter of mechanics--or to win for their clients

1388
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:06,400
a favorable decision in the matter of costs of maintenance and operation

1389
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:12,480
of a railway, in a case of this kind. As has been said, figures don't

1390
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:15,240
lie, but figurers sometimes do.

1391
01:32:15,240 --> 01:32:15,280


1392
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:20,240
Other instances of breach of engineering ethics, however otherwise

1393
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:25,240
secure from the clutches of the law, occur to the writer, but the two

1394
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:30,440
just cited ought to serve. At best, the topic is unpleasant and by no

1395
01:32:30,440 --> 01:32:35,160
means indicates the character of the profession as a whole. Where there

1396
01:32:35,160 --> 01:32:39,720
is one engineer who will perjure himself in the fashion as set forth

1397
01:32:39,720 --> 01:32:44,120
above there are many thousands of engineers who could not be bought for

1398
01:32:44,120 --> 01:32:49,120
this purpose at any amount of money. The profession of engineering is

1399
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:54,720
notably clean; its code of ethics rigidly adhered to; the rights of

1400
01:32:54,720 --> 01:32:59,640
others, both in and out of the profession, regarded with something akin

1401
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:06,320
to sacredness. Engineers, as a body, for instance, possess a peculiarly

1402
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:10,680
rigid idea concerning themselves in relation to branches of the

1403
01:33:10,680 --> 01:33:14,800
profession outside their own and yet intimately close to their own.

1404
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:18,960
Called in as an expert in the matter of heating and lighting a building,

1405
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:24,360
say, the heating and lighting engineer will rigidly confine himself to

1406
01:33:24,360 --> 01:33:29,440
this phase of the engineering venture and to no other, however he may

1407
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:33,600
find his work again and again overlapping the work of the structural

1408
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:38,400
engineer or the industrial engineer--phases concerning which he may

1409
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:43,160
possess important knowledge. He regards these things as strictly none of

1410
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:48,000
his business, and in doing so conserves the esteem and friendship of his

1411
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:49,440
confrères.

1412
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:49,440


1413
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:54,800
The code of ethics is a liberal one among the engineering groups. It has

1414
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:58,640
been laid down with an eye to fairness both for the practitioner and

1415
01:33:58,640 --> 01:34:04,200
the client. Rigidly held to, it will admit of no engineer going far

1416
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:09,800
wrong in the practice of his profession, and, broken, will not land him

1417
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:15,280
in jail. It is presupposed that engineers are men of intelligence. A man

1418
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:20,160
of intelligence will hold himself to the spirit of the Ten Commandments

1419
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:25,080
if he would attain to success, and to the letter of them if he would be

1420
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:30,640
happy during the declining days of his life. Most engineers realize this

1421
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:35,720
and accept it as their every-day working creed. Life to them, like the

1422
01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:40,200
medium through which they give expression to their ideas, is a matter of

1423
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:45,160
mathematics. Two steps taken in a wrong direction mean an equal number

1424
01:34:45,160 --> 01:34:50,400
of steps forcibly retraced--or the whole problem goes wrong. Engineers

1425
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:55,320
rarely take the two steps in the wrong direction. When they do take

1426
01:34:55,320 --> 01:34:59,960
wrong steps they are quick to right them. For the code is always before

1427
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:00,920
their eyes.

1428
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:00,960


1429
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:00,960


1430
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:00,960


1431
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:01,000


1432
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:01,640
X

1433
01:35:01,640 --> 01:35:01,640


1434
01:35:01,640 --> 01:35:03,640
FUTURE OF THE ENGINEER

1435
01:35:03,640 --> 01:35:03,680


1436
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:03,680


1437
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:08,200
Just at present the future of the engineer is more richly promising than

1438
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:12,640
it might otherwise have been but for the war. Due to the period of

1439
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:17,760
reconstruction now confronting the world, a work almost wholly that of

1440
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:22,600
the engineering professions, engineers for a period of a decade at least

1441
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:27,720
are destined to be overburdened with projects. Nor will any one branch

1442
01:35:27,720 --> 01:35:33,200
be occupied to the exclusion of any other branch or branches. Civil and

1443
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:38,480
structural engineers will, as a matter of course, have the first call;

1444
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:41,920
but with the work of these men well under way--consisting of the

1445
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:46,760
reconstruction of towns and cities--mechanical and electrical men will

1446
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:52,600
necessarily be called upon, with, no doubt, liberal demand for mining

1447
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:57,080
engineers. Each branch will have its place and serve its usefulness in

1448
01:35:57,080 --> 01:36:01,880
the order as the reconstruction work itself will fall, with the result

1449
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:05,480
that all branches of the profession will be busily occupied.

1450
01:36:05,480 --> 01:36:05,480


1451
01:36:05,480 --> 01:36:09,120
Manufacturers have been ready or are getting ready for this

1452
01:36:09,120 --> 01:36:14,440
unprecedented promised activity for some little time. Representatives

1453
01:36:14,440 --> 01:36:19,080
are flocking abroad on every boat sailing from these shores with schemes

1454
01:36:19,080 --> 01:36:25,000
and plans for the rapid upbuilding of devastated Europe. These men, for

1455
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:29,520
the most part, are engineers embracing all branches of the profession,

1456
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:34,680
and each is a man especially well qualified to serve in his branch. In a

1457
01:36:34,680 --> 01:36:39,000
way he is a specialist. He may represent a giant structural

1458
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:44,480
organization, or a machine-tool manufacturer, or an electric-lighting

1459
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:48,960
and power concern--any one of the many fields of industrial enterprises

1460
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:53,960
whose product is needed to place demoralized France and Belgium back

1461
01:36:53,960 --> 01:36:59,080
upon a productive basis. For when the construction period is over with

1462
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:03,480
there will be need for machine-tools and equipment for operating these

1463
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:09,160
tools, such as engines and boilers and motors, all of which come

1464
01:37:09,160 --> 01:37:13,320
properly under the head of engineering productive enterprises.

1465
01:37:13,320 --> 01:37:13,360


1466
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:18,200
Engineers--especially American engineers--will be in great demand, as

1467
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:22,880
they are already. Nor will the close of the reconstruction period

1468
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:27,520
witness an abatement of this demand. Having once entered the foreign

1469
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:32,240
field on a large scale, they will of necessity continue to be in demand

1470
01:37:32,240 --> 01:37:37,400
not only for the furtherance of industrial projects, but for purposes of

1471
01:37:37,400 --> 01:37:42,080
maintaining that which has been installed at their hands. Machinery has

1472
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:47,040
a way of needing periodical overhauling--even the best of machinery--and

1473
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:51,920
this will entail the services of many engineers for long after the

1474
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:57,080
machinery itself has been set up. The services of erecting engines,

1475
01:37:57,080 --> 01:38:02,520
operating engineers, supervising engineers--known more properly as

1476
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:08,240
industrial engineers--following, as the need will, close upon the heels

1477
01:38:08,240 --> 01:38:12,360
of the constructing and selling men--will keep the many branches alive

1478
01:38:12,360 --> 01:38:16,920
and in foreign trade for much more than a decade--or so it seems to the

1479
01:38:16,920 --> 01:38:22,480
writer. Other nations may, of course, whip into the field and in time

1480
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:27,000
crowd out the more distant--meaning American--engineers and engineering

1481
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:32,200
products. But I don't think so, because of the acknowledged supremacy of

1482
01:38:32,200 --> 01:38:37,680
American engineers in many directions. The war itself taught the world

1483
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:42,120
that we possessed such a supremacy, and the world will be slow to

1484
01:38:42,120 --> 01:38:46,840
forget--especially the purchasing side of nations themselves so crippled

1485
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:50,960
of man-power as to be for a generation well-nigh helpless.

1486
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:51,000


1487
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:56,840
So the immediate future of the engineer is richly promising. It is so

1488
01:38:56,840 --> 01:39:00,880
rich with promise that a young man could hardly do better than to enter

1489
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:06,880
upon engineering as a life-work, provided he has no particular choice of

1490
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:12,440
careers, and would enter upon an attractive and scopeful one. His work

1491
01:39:12,440 --> 01:39:17,280
is already laid out for him. Taking up a course of study leading to the

1492
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:24,440
degree of M.E., or C.E., or E.E., in four years, upon graduating, he can

1493
01:39:24,440 --> 01:39:29,680
retrace his way, or the way of his brother, over the battle-fields of

1494
01:39:29,680 --> 01:39:34,440
Europe, a constructive rather than a destructive agent now, a

1495
01:39:34,440 --> 01:39:40,160
torch-bearer, a pilgrim, a son of democracy once again advancing the

1496
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:45,120
standard in the interests of humanity. He may do this as a mechanical

1497
01:39:45,120 --> 01:39:50,840
engineer, as a civil engineer, as an electrical engineer, as a mining

1498
01:39:50,840 --> 01:39:55,560
engineer; it matters not. What does matter is that he will be carrying

1499
01:39:55,560 --> 01:40:01,280
Old Glory, in spirit if not in the letter, to the distant outposts--the

1500
01:40:01,280 --> 01:40:06,640
especial province of the Anglo-Saxon race, anyway, from the beginnings

1501
01:40:06,640 --> 01:40:10,720
of this race--and so serving to maintain the respect and affection

1502
01:40:10,720 --> 01:40:15,920
already established in these countries by our soldiery. To the writer

1503
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:18,120
the thing looks mighty attractive.

1504
01:40:18,120 --> 01:40:18,200


1505
01:40:18,200 --> 01:40:22,560
Yet the young engineer's future need not lie in distant places

1506
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:27,440
necessarily. He may stay at home and still have his work cut out for

1507
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:32,640
him. The promised unparalleled activity in the field of engineering on

1508
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:37,160
the other side cannot but enlarge and accentuate the activity on this

1509
01:40:37,160 --> 01:40:42,320
side of the water. Plants will be operating full blast to catch up with

1510
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:47,600
the demand imposed by this abnormal activity, and thus the engineer will

1511
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:51,720
perforce bear the burdens of production. He will bear them in all

1512
01:40:51,720 --> 01:40:57,120
directions, since industrial activity means engineering activity, and

1513
01:40:57,120 --> 01:41:02,240
the work of production cannot go on without him. In the mines, the

1514
01:41:02,240 --> 01:41:07,800
mills, the quarries, the foundry, the machine-shop, the pattern-shop,

1515
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:12,400
the drafting-room, the engineering offices, the consulting

1516
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:17,080
divisions--all these, necessitating as they do the employment of one or

1517
01:41:17,080 --> 01:41:22,520
more engineers in at least a supervising capacity, will have urgent need

1518
01:41:22,520 --> 01:41:27,640
for his services. Constructive work always, he will grow as his work

1519
01:41:27,640 --> 01:41:31,720
grows, and because the growth of his work under these abnormal

1520
01:41:31,720 --> 01:41:36,360
conditions will be of itself abnormal, his own growth under these

1521
01:41:36,360 --> 01:41:41,200
conditions will be abnormal. He will find himself a full engineer before

1522
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:42,960
his rightful time.

1523
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:42,960


1524
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:46,600
Right here it would be well to point out to the young graduate the

1525
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:52,200
importance of getting under a capable engineer. For, much as the writer

1526
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:56,600
dislikes to admit it, there are engineers who are not capable and who

1527
01:41:56,600 --> 01:42:02,040
yet occupy positions of great responsibility. The young engineer, fresh

1528
01:42:02,040 --> 01:42:07,480
from college and a bit puzzled as to the game as a whole, if he accept a

1529
01:42:07,480 --> 01:42:12,040
connection under an engineer, for instance, whose inventive ideas are

1530
01:42:12,040 --> 01:42:16,760
impractical, will unwittingly absorb such a man's viewpoint on

1531
01:42:16,760 --> 01:42:22,280
construction, and so spoil himself as an engineer for all time to come.

1532
01:42:22,280 --> 01:42:27,520
Cases like this are not rare. The writer personally knows of more than

1533
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:31,840
one young man who enlisted under an engineer whose ideas on

1534
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:37,080
administration probably accounted, being as they were good ideas, for

1535
01:42:37,080 --> 01:42:42,120
his position of authority over matters not strictly of an administrative

1536
01:42:42,120 --> 01:42:47,480
nature. The man wanted to exercise his authority over all things within

1537
01:42:47,480 --> 01:42:51,520
his department--not the least of which was machine design--with the

1538
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:56,200
result that the young graduate's normally practical viewpoint on matters

1539
01:42:56,200 --> 01:43:00,920
of construction became warped into that of the man over him, and

1540
01:43:00,920 --> 01:43:05,720
continued warped for so long as he remained under this man, and

1541
01:43:05,720 --> 01:43:11,320
frequently longer, indeed, to the end of his engineering career. The

1542
01:43:11,320 --> 01:43:15,840
young engineer must pick his boss as our young men are facetiously

1543
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:21,480
advised to pick their parents. The wrong selection will prove disastrous

1544
01:43:21,480 --> 01:43:23,400
to him in after-life.

1545
01:43:23,400 --> 01:43:23,440


1546
01:43:23,440 --> 01:43:28,080
Which is but an aside--though a very important one. To emulate a

1547
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:32,160
weakling in whatever walk of life, be it painting or writing or

1548
01:43:32,160 --> 01:43:37,480
engineering, means to begin wrong. Everybody knows the importance of a

1549
01:43:37,480 --> 01:43:41,680
right beginning. It is no less true of the young engineer than of

1550
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:42,400
others.

1551
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:42,400


1552
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:47,040
And what with the example set by Herbert Hoover and other dollar-a-year

1553
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:53,240
men, mostly engineers, in the nation's administrative affairs during the

1554
01:43:53,240 --> 01:43:57,640
war, the future of the engineer looks bright in these quarters as well

1555
01:43:57,640 --> 01:44:02,760
as in quarters embracing engineering constructive work wholly. The

1556
01:44:02,760 --> 01:44:07,480
engineer of the future undoubtedly will take active part in municipal

1557
01:44:07,480 --> 01:44:12,360
and national affairs, more likely than not in time entering upon a

1558
01:44:12,360 --> 01:44:16,800
political career as a side interest, as the lawyer enters upon it

1559
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:21,080
to-day, within time--so it seems to the writer--members of the

1560
01:44:21,080 --> 01:44:26,320
engineering professions occupying positions of great trust, such as

1561
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:31,520
state governorships and--who knows?--the Presidency itself. Certainly

1562
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:36,000
the hand points this way. More and more engineers are coming into

1563
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:40,960
prominence in the public eye, and with every member of the profession so

1564
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:45,960
coming, the respect for men of his profession multiplies among laymen.

1565
01:44:45,960 --> 01:44:51,760
It is not too much to say, therefore, that engineers are destined to

1566
01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:56,640
fill places of great political power. It is to be hoped that they are.

1567
01:44:56,640 --> 01:45:00,840
Whether they do or not, the future at this writing amply promises it,

1568
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:05,400
and so forcibly that it may well be included as existing for the

1569
01:45:05,400 --> 01:45:09,480
engineer, as being a part of the future of the engineer.

1570
01:45:09,480 --> 01:45:09,480


1571
01:45:09,480 --> 01:45:09,480


1572
01:45:09,480 --> 01:45:09,480


1573
01:45:09,480 --> 01:45:09,480


1574
01:45:09,480 --> 01:45:10,920
XI

1575
01:45:10,920 --> 01:45:10,920


1576
01:45:10,920 --> 01:45:13,280
WHAT CONSTITUTES ENGINEERING SUCCESS

1577
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:13,280


1578
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:13,280


1579
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:18,800
A graduate of Cornell, in the class of '05, after placing away his

1580
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:24,120
diploma where it could not trouble him through suggestiveness, accepted

1581
01:45:24,120 --> 01:45:28,920
a position with a large manufacturing concern in western Pennsylvania.

1582
01:45:28,920 --> 01:45:33,240
He was twenty-three years old. He went into the shop to get the

1583
01:45:33,240 --> 01:45:37,440
practical side of certain theories imposed upon his receptive nature

1584
01:45:37,440 --> 01:45:43,080
through four long years of study in a mechanical-engineering course. The

1585
01:45:43,080 --> 01:45:48,440
concern manufactured among other things steam-turbines, and this young

1586
01:45:48,440 --> 01:45:52,920
man, having demonstrated in school his particular aptitude for

1587
01:45:52,920 --> 01:45:57,880
thermodynamics--the study of heat and its units in its application to

1588
01:45:57,880 --> 01:46:02,520
engines, and the like--entered the erecting department. Donning

1589
01:46:02,520 --> 01:46:07,240
overalls, and with ordinary rule in his hip pocket--as against the

1590
01:46:07,240 --> 01:46:12,000
slide-rule with which he had worked out his theoretical calculations

1591
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:16,400
during his college years--he went to work at whatever was assigned him

1592
01:46:16,400 --> 01:46:21,920
as a task by his superiors--shop foremen, assistant superintendent,

1593
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:24,640
occasionally an engineer from the office.

1594
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:24,640


1595
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:30,040
This young man did many things. He helped to assemble turbine parts;

1596
01:46:30,040 --> 01:46:35,600
carried word of petty alterations to the proper officials: assisted in

1597
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:40,440
the work of making tests; made detailed reports on the machine's

1598
01:46:40,440 --> 01:46:46,480
performance; screwed up and backed off nuts; in short, got very well

1599
01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:51,400
acquainted with the steam-turbine as manufactured by this company. He

1600
01:46:51,400 --> 01:46:56,120
knew the fundamentals of machine construction, and an understanding of

1601
01:46:56,120 --> 01:47:00,640
the details of this particular type of turbine therefore came easy to

1602
01:47:00,640 --> 01:47:07,200
him. He worked shop hours, carried his lunch in a box, changed his

1603
01:47:07,200 --> 01:47:12,440
overalls every Monday like a veteran. Usually his overalls more than

1604
01:47:12,440 --> 01:47:16,880
needed changing, because he was not afraid of the grease and grime with

1605
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:21,600
which he came into contact throughout the day. He liked the work and

1606
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:26,400
went to it like a dog to a bone. He was applying in a practical way what

1607
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:31,560
he had learned in college of a theoretical nature, and finding the thing

1608
01:47:31,560 --> 01:47:33,080
of amazing interest.

1609
01:47:33,080 --> 01:47:33,080


1610
01:47:33,080 --> 01:47:37,560
He made progress. In time his work was brought to the attention of the

1611
01:47:37,560 --> 01:47:43,120
chief engineer, and one day, when the president of the company, who was

1612
01:47:43,120 --> 01:47:47,560
also an inventor of national repute and responsible for the design of

1613
01:47:47,560 --> 01:47:52,800
the turbine being manufactured by the organization, wanted to make

1614
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:57,360
certain bold changes in the design, the chief engineer sent for the

1615
01:47:57,360 --> 01:48:02,200
young engineer whose work in college in thermodynamics had won for him

1616
01:48:02,200 --> 01:48:07,360
certain honors, with the result that our hero found himself presently

1617
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:12,760
seated opposite the president at a table in the latter's office, engaged

1618
01:48:12,760 --> 01:48:17,680
in working out calculations on his slide-rule--calculations beyond the

1619
01:48:17,680 --> 01:48:22,400
powers of the president, because he was not a heavy theoretician. This

1620
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:28,000
call was a big advance indeed, for it marked him as a man of promise--a

1621
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:32,120
"comer"--in the concern. The president liked the ease with which the

1622
01:48:32,120 --> 01:48:36,600
young engineer "got" him in the matter of the proposed changes, and

1623
01:48:36,600 --> 01:48:42,400
quite before either realized it both were talking freely, exchanging

1624
01:48:42,400 --> 01:48:47,720
ideas, in the field of turbine construction generally. The young man

1625
01:48:47,720 --> 01:48:52,040
unconsciously was driving home the fact that he was a capable engineer,

1626
01:48:52,040 --> 01:48:57,880
one who, while still lacking in broad experience, was nevertheless

1627
01:48:57,880 --> 01:49:02,480
possessed of the proper attitude toward engineering as a whole to compel

1628
01:49:02,480 --> 01:49:05,640
the interest and attention of his superior.

1629
01:49:05,640 --> 01:49:05,640


1630
01:49:05,640 --> 01:49:10,280
The young man eventually was sent out upon the road as an erecting man.

1631
01:49:10,280 --> 01:49:15,160
In this work he discovered certain operating faults in the design, and,

1632
01:49:15,160 --> 01:49:20,400
reporting these faults to the home office, observed that not a few were

1633
01:49:20,400 --> 01:49:25,240
remedied in subsequent designs. He moved about the country from place to

1634
01:49:25,240 --> 01:49:30,840
place, setting up and operating steam-turbines, until there came the

1635
01:49:30,840 --> 01:49:34,760
blissful day when he was called back to join the engineering staff in

1636
01:49:34,760 --> 01:49:41,400
work covering design. Laying aside his overalls, he emerged as a crisp

1637
01:49:41,400 --> 01:49:46,040
young engineer in a linen collar and nifty cravat--although not till

1638
01:49:46,040 --> 01:49:51,160
later did he don a cream-colored waistcoat--and thereafter his hours

1639
01:49:51,160 --> 01:49:56,480
were seven instead of nine. With a desk and a stenographer he entered

1640
01:49:56,480 --> 01:50:01,840
upon work of a somewhat statistical character. He followed the designs

1641
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:05,720
of rival companies as best he could through their advertising and

1642
01:50:05,720 --> 01:50:09,840
articles covering their respective designs appearing in the technical

1643
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:15,200
journals, and about this time also applied for admission, and was

1644
01:50:15,200 --> 01:50:20,240
granted it, in the foremost engineering society embracing his particular

1645
01:50:20,240 --> 01:50:23,840
branch of the profession. He was still making progress.

1646
01:50:23,840 --> 01:50:23,880


1647
01:50:23,880 --> 01:50:28,400
Likewise, he was rapidly becoming an expert in the field of

1648
01:50:28,400 --> 01:50:33,680
steam-turbines. His work in the shop, together with his experience on

1649
01:50:33,680 --> 01:50:38,760
the road, both as an erecting man and operating engineer, had eminently

1650
01:50:38,760 --> 01:50:42,840
fitted him for valuable service in the home office as an engineer

1651
01:50:42,840 --> 01:50:48,720
overseeing design. His work in charge of design, where his knowledge of

1652
01:50:48,720 --> 01:50:53,160
what had given service both good and bad in details of construction

1653
01:50:53,160 --> 01:50:58,000
while he was in the field, was extremely valuable to the designer

1654
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:04,000
himself, was rapidly rounding him out as a steam-turbine man. His salary

1655
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:09,080
had gone up apace with his progress; he had met the right girl at a club

1656
01:51:09,080 --> 01:51:14,240
dance in the suburban town where he had taken modest quarters; he was

1657
01:51:14,240 --> 01:51:19,200
rapidly headed toward success both as an engineer and a citizen. He had

1658
01:51:19,200 --> 01:51:23,880
been out of school probably six years, and was still a very young man,

1659
01:51:23,880 --> 01:51:26,880
with all the world practically before him.

1660
01:51:26,880 --> 01:51:26,880


1661
01:51:26,880 --> 01:51:31,520
One day he was asked by the chief engineer of the concern to journey to

1662
01:51:31,520 --> 01:51:37,200
New York, and read a paper before his engineering society at one of the

1663
01:51:37,200 --> 01:51:42,480
regular annual meetings, on the subject of thermodynamics in its

1664
01:51:42,480 --> 01:51:47,520
relation to the company's own product--the turbine. He tipped over his

1665
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:52,240
chair in his eagerness to get out of the office and on the train. He

1666
01:51:52,240 --> 01:51:57,640
realized the importance of this opportunity. He was to appear before his

1667
01:51:57,640 --> 01:52:01,920
fellow-engineers--the best and most capable and prominent in the

1668
01:52:01,920 --> 01:52:06,720
profession--and to appear as an authority on his subject! The thing was

1669
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:12,160
another step forward. He prepared a paper, basing it on his six years'

1670
01:52:12,160 --> 01:52:17,440
experience in steam-turbines, and when he reached New York had something

1671
01:52:17,440 --> 01:52:22,240
of value to tell his brother engineers. The meeting was held in the

1672
01:52:22,240 --> 01:52:27,520
afternoon, and, dressing for the part, he stepped out upon the platform

1673
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:32,440
before a gathering of some eight or nine hundred engineers and delivered

1674
01:52:32,440 --> 01:52:37,640
himself of his subject with credit to himself and to his organization.

1675
01:52:37,640 --> 01:52:43,440
Not only that. In the rebuttal, when engineers seated in the auditorium

1676
01:52:43,440 --> 01:52:47,720
rose to confound him with questions--engineers representing rival

1677
01:52:47,720 --> 01:52:52,280
turbine concerns--he proved himself quick at the bat and more than once

1678
01:52:52,280 --> 01:52:55,280
confounded those who would confound him.

1679
01:52:55,280 --> 01:52:55,360


1680
01:52:55,360 --> 01:53:00,280
He was making his mark on the industrial times. His paper was reviewed

1681
01:53:00,280 --> 01:53:04,560
in the technical journals and almost overnight our young hero found

1682
01:53:04,560 --> 01:53:10,120
himself recognized as an authority in his chosen branch. He was sought

1683
01:53:10,120 --> 01:53:15,520
out for other articles by technical editors, his associates in the home

1684
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:20,720
plant generously commended him for his work; his salary received another

1685
01:53:20,720 --> 01:53:25,240
elevation; he called on the girl that night and had her set the date.

1686
01:53:25,240 --> 01:53:29,240
Then he plugged for salvation--further knowledge as a turbine

1687
01:53:29,240 --> 01:53:34,160
man--harder than ever. Having won the full confidence of the officials

1688
01:53:34,160 --> 01:53:38,840
of the company by this time, he was given free voice in all matters

1689
01:53:38,840 --> 01:53:43,480
having to do with the design of their product, and shortly after his

1690
01:53:43,480 --> 01:53:47,880
first little boy was born was promoted to the position of assistant

1691
01:53:47,880 --> 01:53:53,480
chief engineer. He served in this capacity for two years, and then,

1692
01:53:53,480 --> 01:53:58,160
realizing that he had gone as far up in the organization as it was

1693
01:53:58,160 --> 01:54:03,040
physically possible to go, owing to the fact that the chief engineer was

1694
01:54:03,040 --> 01:54:07,360
the president's sister's husband--or something like that--he accepted an

1695
01:54:07,360 --> 01:54:12,120
offer from one of the rival concerns manufacturing turbines and entered

1696
01:54:12,120 --> 01:54:17,280
the organization as chief engineer at a salary too big to mention. Our

1697
01:54:17,280 --> 01:54:20,040
young friend had at last arrived.

1698
01:54:20,040 --> 01:54:20,040


1699
01:54:20,040 --> 01:54:25,320
Yet his success was not quite complete, nor will it be complete, until

1700
01:54:25,320 --> 01:54:31,080
he sets up, as he assuredly will some day, as a consulting engineer.

1701
01:54:31,080 --> 01:54:35,560
When he at last does this, when he swings out his shingle to the breeze,

1702
01:54:35,560 --> 01:54:39,880
he will then have attained to the maximum of possible success as an

1703
01:54:39,880 --> 01:54:45,640
engineer. Already recognized as being possessed of a fine discrimination

1704
01:54:45,640 --> 01:54:50,440
in matters of engineering moment, especially in thermodynamics as

1705
01:54:50,440 --> 01:54:55,880
related to turbines, he has but gone up in channels early laid out for

1706
01:54:55,880 --> 01:55:02,080
him, and indicated to him, in his college days. His direction even then

1707
01:55:02,080 --> 01:55:07,760
was clearly marked. All he had to do, and all he did do, was to develop

1708
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:11,640
himself in this single direction. He did nothing that would be

1709
01:55:11,640 --> 01:55:16,960
impossible to any other engineering graduate. Merely he hewed to the

1710
01:55:16,960 --> 01:55:21,400
line--persisted in remaining in the one branch of the game--met with his

1711
01:55:21,400 --> 01:55:26,440
reward in time just as any young man would meet with it. There was

1712
01:55:26,440 --> 01:55:32,480
nothing of phenomenal character, nothing of the genius, revealed in what

1713
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:37,200
he did. His way is open to all. And it is a way both worthy and

1714
01:55:37,200 --> 01:55:42,200
admirable, for to-day this engineer stands high in his profession and is

1715
01:55:42,200 --> 01:55:46,760
meeting with financial reward in keeping with his position among

1716
01:55:46,760 --> 01:55:47,880
engineers.

1717
01:55:47,880 --> 01:55:47,880


1718
01:55:47,880 --> 01:55:52,240
There you have in the tracing of one engineer's progress to success

1719
01:55:52,240 --> 01:55:58,120
precisely what constitutes engineering success. The details may differ,

1720
01:55:58,120 --> 01:56:02,560
but the principles and the rewards will be the same, whether you enter

1721
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:08,080
upon civil or mechanical or mining or electrical engineering. Success in

1722
01:56:08,080 --> 01:56:13,240
engineering constitutes certain satisfactory money rewards and an even

1723
01:56:13,240 --> 01:56:18,440
more satisfactory recognition by one's associates and fellows. Success

1724
01:56:18,440 --> 01:56:24,480
in anything is that. A man must work for them, however. There never was

1725
01:56:24,480 --> 01:56:29,360
and never will be a rainbow path to the heights. Toil and an abiding

1726
01:56:29,360 --> 01:56:34,640
faith in one's own capabilities--these make for success. Success makes

1727
01:56:34,640 --> 01:56:40,600
for happiness, and happiness, as everybody knows, is all there is to

1728
01:56:40,600 --> 01:56:41,400
this life.

1729
01:56:41,400 --> 01:56:41,400


1730
01:56:41,400 --> 01:56:43,600
I wish all men happiness.

1731
01:56:43,600 --> 01:56:43,600


1732
01:56:43,600 --> 01:56:43,600


1733
01:56:43,600 --> 01:56:43,640


1734
01:56:43,640 --> 01:56:43,640


1735
01:56:43,640 --> 01:56:44,560
XII

1736
01:56:44,560 --> 01:56:44,560


1737
01:56:44,560 --> 01:56:46,080
THE PERSONAL SIDE

1738
01:56:46,080 --> 01:56:46,120


1739
01:56:46,120 --> 01:56:46,120


1740
01:56:46,120 --> 01:56:50,760
As to the personal side of engineering as a career, if it would be a

1741
01:56:50,760 --> 01:56:54,720
source of gratification to you to know that you were helping to build up

1742
01:56:54,720 --> 01:56:59,400
the civilized world, then you should enter the engineering profession.

1743
01:56:59,400 --> 01:57:03,720
Because men differ in their ideas as to what constitutes a full

1744
01:57:03,720 --> 01:57:09,160
life--some placing ideal homes above all things, some seeking

1745
01:57:09,160 --> 01:57:14,040
continuously diversified sources of pleasure, some wanting nothing

1746
01:57:14,040 --> 01:57:18,440
better than a fine library or freedom to cultivate taste in pictures,

1747
01:57:18,440 --> 01:57:23,440
some wishing only to surround themselves with interesting people, some

1748
01:57:23,440 --> 01:57:28,640
wanting nothing but an accumulation of dollars, some wishing but for

1749
01:57:28,640 --> 01:57:32,920
power of control over others--all men would not find the full life in

1750
01:57:32,920 --> 01:57:38,720
engineering. Yet the majority of men would, because the profession holds

1751
01:57:38,720 --> 01:57:42,760
that which would appeal to a great many different ideas as to what a

1752
01:57:42,760 --> 01:57:47,400
complete life consists of. Engineering as a profession is scientific,

1753
01:57:47,400 --> 01:57:52,800
idealistic, constructive, profitable. It is combative--in the sense

1754
01:57:52,800 --> 01:57:57,240
that it shapes nature's forces--and it calls for a sense of artistry in

1755
01:57:57,240 --> 01:58:02,680
its practitioners. Added to these, it embraces a certain kind of

1756
01:58:02,680 --> 01:58:06,760
profound knowledge the possession of which is always a source of pride

1757
01:58:06,760 --> 01:58:07,520
to the owner.

1758
01:58:07,520 --> 01:58:07,520


1759
01:58:07,520 --> 01:58:13,560
Let me explain this last. The engineer, being as he is a man who views

1760
01:58:13,560 --> 01:58:18,200
things objectively, notes details in everything that comes under his

1761
01:58:18,200 --> 01:58:23,880
eye, be it dwelling or automobile, or bookbinding or highway. The layman

1762
01:58:23,880 --> 01:58:30,040
does not. The layman, outside his work, sees only the thing itself, when

1763
01:58:30,040 --> 01:58:35,120
looking at it--the general outline. But the engineer, trained to note

1764
01:58:35,120 --> 01:58:40,600
details in construction, observes detail at a glance, and does it almost

1765
01:58:40,600 --> 01:58:46,280
subconsciously, if not immediately after leaving school, then assuredly

1766
01:58:46,280 --> 01:58:51,160
later, after he has been practicing his profession for a time. His

1767
01:58:51,160 --> 01:58:55,760
outlook is objectively critical. Entering a house for the first time,

1768
01:58:55,760 --> 01:59:00,480
and trained as a mechanical engineer, he will note the character of the

1769
01:59:00,480 --> 01:59:05,520
woodwork, the decorations, the atmosphere, the arrangement of the

1770
01:59:05,520 --> 01:59:10,040
furnishings, all with the same facility that he will note details upon

1771
01:59:10,040 --> 01:59:14,320
entering for the first time a power-station or a manufacturing

1772
01:59:14,320 --> 01:59:16,880
plant--things within his own province.

1773
01:59:16,880 --> 01:59:16,920


1774
01:59:16,920 --> 01:59:21,920
Nor is this faculty confined to the concrete. Engineers are of that

1775
01:59:21,920 --> 01:59:26,440
deeply instinctive race of folk who perceive cause in effect with the

1776
01:59:26,440 --> 01:59:31,440
lightning swiftness of a wild animal. If they are not this when entering

1777
01:59:31,440 --> 01:59:36,560
upon the profession, assuredly they become so after a period spent in

1778
01:59:36,560 --> 01:59:41,160
the work. Something about the practice of engineering breeds it--breeds

1779
01:59:41,160 --> 01:59:45,480
this objective seeing and abstract reasoning--and to be possessed of it

1780
01:59:45,480 --> 01:59:50,760
is to get more out of life than otherwise is possible. Which possibly

1781
01:59:50,760 --> 01:59:54,640
accounts for the fact that engineers as a group seem to have a

1782
01:59:54,640 --> 01:59:59,360
common-sense viewpoint of things, one that is frankly acknowledged and

1783
01:59:59,360 --> 02:00:04,440
drawn upon when needed by men in other walks of life. Engineers are

1784
02:00:04,440 --> 02:00:09,200
extremely practical-minded, and this makes for a certain outlook that

1785
02:00:09,200 --> 02:00:13,680
will not permit of visionary scaring away from the common sense and the

1786
02:00:13,680 --> 02:00:18,560
practical on the part of its possessor. Engineers know why things occur

1787
02:00:18,560 --> 02:00:23,200
without having witnessed even the occurrence itself. Their powers of

1788
02:00:23,200 --> 02:00:27,480
reasoning are developed to degrees beyond the average--or they seem to

1789
02:00:27,480 --> 02:00:31,880
be--and out of this comes one of the sources of gratification on the

1790
02:00:31,880 --> 02:00:36,520
personal side to the man who pursues engineering as a profession.

1791
02:00:36,520 --> 02:00:36,560


1792
02:00:36,560 --> 02:00:41,320
The thing spreads out as I contemplate it. I would make so bold as to

1793
02:00:41,320 --> 02:00:45,880
say that the man of engineering training will see more at a glance when

1794
02:00:45,880 --> 02:00:51,480
first viewing the Grand Cañon, say, than will any other professionally

1795
02:00:51,480 --> 02:00:56,600
trained man. Should the Cañon collapse, he would know instantly why it

1796
02:00:56,600 --> 02:01:01,360
collapsed. He could give an opinion on the wonderful color effects that

1797
02:01:01,360 --> 02:01:05,880
would interest the artist, and he would know without hesitation how best

1798
02:01:05,880 --> 02:01:10,600
to descend to the bottom and wherein to seek the easiest trail. All

1799
02:01:10,600 --> 02:01:16,760
this, without his being a civil or a mining engineer, understand; merely

1800
02:01:16,760 --> 02:01:22,000
a man trained in constructive mechanics. On the other hand, the mining

1801
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:26,520
or the civil man would view the wreckage of a locomotive accident and

1802
02:01:26,520 --> 02:01:31,240
see in the debris, select from the snarl of tangled wheels and

1803
02:01:31,240 --> 02:01:36,040
driving-arms and axles a ready picture of the nature of the accident and

1804
02:01:36,040 --> 02:01:41,320
how much of the wreckage offered possibilities for repair. Again, the

1805
02:01:41,320 --> 02:01:46,600
engineer sees in a tree, with its tapering trunk, the symbol of all

1806
02:01:46,600 --> 02:01:51,240
tower construction, just as he sees in the shape of a man's arm the

1807
02:01:51,240 --> 02:01:55,720
pattern to follow when devising a cast-iron lever for an automatic

1808
02:01:55,720 --> 02:02:02,440
machine. He sees things, does the engineer; sees objectively; follows

1809
02:02:02,440 --> 02:02:03,920
nature throughout.

1810
02:02:03,920 --> 02:02:04,000


1811
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:08,440
All this being true, the engineer has a rather interesting life of it.

1812
02:02:08,440 --> 02:02:12,880
For not only does he see a little more clearly than otherwise would be

1813
02:02:12,880 --> 02:02:17,960
possible to him without his education and training, but also he does

1814
02:02:17,960 --> 02:02:22,280
things with his hands that come easy to him without previously having

1815
02:02:22,280 --> 02:02:28,080
undertaken them. The engineer can do much around his own home, if he so

1816
02:02:28,080 --> 02:02:33,720
choose, that of itself is a source of great satisfaction. Engineers can

1817
02:02:33,720 --> 02:02:41,160
swing doors, build fireplaces, landscape, erect fences, make garden, and

1818
02:02:41,160 --> 02:02:45,480
can perform these tasks with a degree of neatness and skill that brings

1819
02:02:45,480 --> 02:02:50,840
favorable comment from journeymen whose vocations this work is, and do

1820
02:02:50,840 --> 02:02:54,920
the work without training whatsoever in the work. Wall-papering,

1821
02:02:54,920 --> 02:03:00,560
painting, carpentering, laying up of brick, or the placing of a dry

1822
02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:05,160
wall--plastering, glazing--the list is endless that as side-plays are

1823
02:03:05,160 --> 02:03:10,360
possible to the man with an engineering training. He need not do these

1824
02:03:10,360 --> 02:03:15,840
things, ever; but if he wants ever to do them, he finds that he can do

1825
02:03:15,840 --> 02:03:20,680
them and do a creditable job of each, and this without his ever having

1826
02:03:20,680 --> 02:03:23,160
turned his hand to the work before.

1827
02:03:23,160 --> 02:03:23,200


1828
02:03:23,200 --> 02:03:27,800
Which sums up in a measure the personal side. The engineer is not a

1829
02:03:27,800 --> 02:03:32,960
superior being. Merely he is a man possessed of a highly specialized

1830
02:03:32,960 --> 02:03:37,680
education and training which peculiarly fits him for any practical work,

1831
02:03:37,680 --> 02:03:42,040
and out of this work, for practical thinking of the kind known as

1832
02:03:42,040 --> 02:03:47,440
constructive. Being constructive with his hands, he cannot but in time

1833
02:03:47,440 --> 02:03:52,040
become constructive with his brain. Being constructive as a thinker

1834
02:03:52,040 --> 02:03:57,760
first, he cannot but become constructive as a doer later. The one hinges

1835
02:03:57,760 --> 02:04:03,160
closely on the other, and having both, as the engineer must who would be

1836
02:04:03,160 --> 02:04:07,920
a successful engineer, he has as much of the world under his control as

1837
02:04:07,920 --> 02:04:13,520
comes to any man, and, in a great degree, more than is the favorable lot

1838
02:04:13,520 --> 02:04:18,480
of most men. For the engineer is both a thinker and a doer. Ponder

1839
02:04:18,480 --> 02:04:22,960
that--you. Men are either one or the other--most men--and rarely are

1840
02:04:22,960 --> 02:04:28,160
they both. Either side of their brain has been developed at the expense

1841
02:04:28,160 --> 02:04:34,000
of the other side. Not so with the engineer. The successful engineer is

1842
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:38,840
both thinker and doer--must be in his profession. It seems to me that

1843
02:04:38,840 --> 02:04:42,200
engineering has many beautiful attractions as a profession.

1844
02:04:42,200 --> 02:04:42,200


1845

1863

(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without

1864
02:05:32,760 --> 02:05:37,000
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,

1865
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:42,720
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property

If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project

1903

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

1908
02:08:18,880 --> 02:08:23,600
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who

1909
02:08:23,600 --> 02:08:27,880
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few

1910
02:08:27,880 --> 02:08:32,880
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1911
02:08:32,880 --> 02:08:37,560
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

1912
02:08:37,560 --> 02:08:42,920
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project

1913
02:08:42,920 --> 02:08:47,800
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1914
02:08:47,800 --> 02:08:53,480
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic

1915
02:08:53,480 --> 02:08:57,280
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1916

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

1918
02:09:03,680 --> 02:09:09,320
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project

1919
02:09:09,320 --> 02:09:14,960
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the

1920
02:09:14,960 --> 02:09:19,520
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an

1921
02:09:19,520 --> 02:09:24,200
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are

1922
02:09:24,200 --> 02:09:29,840
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from

1923
02:09:29,840 --> 02:09:35,280
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative

1924
02:09:35,280 --> 02:09:39,680
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg

1925
02:09:39,680 --> 02:09:44,640
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project

1926
02:09:44,640 --> 02:09:49,960
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

1927
02:09:49,960 --> 02:09:55,320
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of

1928
02:09:55,320 --> 02:10:00,480
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

1929
02:10:00,480 --> 02:10:05,440
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by

1930
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:09,720
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project

1931
02:10:09,720 --> 02:10:14,480

what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

1935
02:10:25,680 --> 02:10:31,000
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check

1936
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:35,040

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or

1938
02:10:41,120 --> 02:10:45,440
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project

1939

phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project

the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of

2109
02:23:00,400 --> 02:23:05,400
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers

2110
02:23:05,400 --> 02:23:11,040
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists

2111
02:23:11,040 --> 02:23:15,520
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from

2112
02:23:15,520 --> 02:23:17,680
people in all walks of life.

2113
02:23:17,680 --> 02:23:17,720


2114
02:23:17,720 --> 02:23:21,920
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the

2115
02:23:21,920 --> 02:23:26,800
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's

2116
02:23:26,800 --> 02:23:31,680
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will

2117
02:23:31,680 --> 02:23:37,680
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project

2118
02:23:37,680 --> 02:23:42,720
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure

2119
02:23:42,720 --> 02:23:47,680
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

2152
02:25:56,160 --> 02:26:01,000
Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide

2153
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:05,160
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of

2154
02:26:05,160 --> 02:26:09,760
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be

2155
02:26:09,760 --> 02:26:14,640
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest

2156
02:26:14,640 --> 02:26:20,200
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations

2157
02:26:20,200 --> 02:26:27,560
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt

2158
02:26:27,560 --> 02:26:29,360
status with the IRS.

2159
02:26:29,360 --> 02:26:29,400


2160
02:26:29,400 --> 02:26:33,640
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating

2161
02:26:33,640 --> 02:26:38,400
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United

2162
02:26:38,400 --> 02:26:43,240
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a

2163
02:26:43,240 --> 02:26:47,640
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up

2164
02:26:47,640 --> 02:26:53,040
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations

2165
02:26:53,040 --> 02:26:57,560
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To

2166
02:26:57,560 --> 02:27:01,760

2169
02:27:10,240 --> 02:27:14,920
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we

2170
02:27:14,920 --> 02:27:20,200
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition

2171
02:27:20,200 --> 02:27:25,200
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who

2172
02:27:25,200 --> 02:27:27,840
approach us with offers to donate.

2173
02:27:27,840 --> 02:27:27,880


2174
02:27:27,880 --> 02:27:32,640

any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from

2176
02:27:36,800 --> 02:27:42,040
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm

2189
02:28:17,320 --> 02:28:22,280
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared

2190
02:28:22,280 --> 02:28:27,960
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project

2191
02:28:27,960 --> 02:28:32,560
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

2193
02:28:32,640 --> 02:28:37,960
Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed

2194
02:28:37,960 --> 02:28:42,320
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.

2195
02:28:42,320 --> 02:28:48,320
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily

2196
02:28:48,320 --> 02:28:52,680
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
